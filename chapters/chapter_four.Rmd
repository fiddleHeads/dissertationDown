## Introduction: *A Convergence of All These Convergences*

In *Young Men and Fire*, Norman Maclean, the author of *A River Runs Through It*, weaves a historical narrative around the circumstances leading to the death of thirteen smokejumpers on the 1949 Mann Gulch Fire in Montana. Maclean tries to make sense of the "individual components" (289) of terrain, wind, fire, and men that form the basis of this tragedy but lands on a story of a 'convergence of all these convergences' (288) that results in a "conflagration" (289), a moment "seemingly beyond the laws of nature, blown into a world where human values and seemingly natural laws no longer apply" (289).

When the 2020 Cameron Peak Fire (CPF) engulfed my family's historic home which had been passed down through five generations over 127 years, in what a fire behavior analyst described as "a wall of fire," (personal communication, 9/17/20), I set out to make sense of the convergences which made something like the CPF possible. The CPF was an extreme wildfire, starting in mid-August and burning for 112 days into the heart of winter in Colorado. While it became and remains the state's largest wildfire, it was hardly the only wildfire that year in Colorado to defy expectations. In a world where wildfires are becoming larger [@rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022], of higher severity [@wassermanClimateInfluencesFuture2023], spreading more rapidly [@balchFastestgrowingMostDestructive2024], and lasting longer [@balikBiogeographicPatternsDaily2024], this paper examines how those who lived through CPF, those who study it, and those who fight and manage wildfire engage in sensemaking to understand wildfire, post-fire impacts, and uncertainty in the context of such landscapes. Sensemaking practices following disaster can (re)shape relations with the material world in a way that broadens temporal and conceptual horizons associated with ecological and climatic uncertainty and degradation, with important policy implications. Engaging ethnographic research methods, I immersed myself in the landscape in which the wildfire had occurred, living in the Poudre Canyon in northern Colorado and interviewing a diverse cohort of people representing community members, fire practitioners, and scientists, to understand wildfire through the lens of their experiences and knowledge systems.

In response to experiences of extreme wildfire and the cascading hazards which unfold as a result, I suggest that individuals, communities, and governments undergo a process of recalibration in ways of knowing the environment. Here I define recalibration "as a process by which, through cataclysmic moments of change, we come to understand the contingent histories and futures" [@daurioTemporalRecalibrationsLearning2023] of our human lives as entangled with other than human material formations and temporal frames. Disaster in the form of wildfire can render past processes of landscape change knowable and recognizable in the present and reorient future expectations in relation to uncertain climates, weathers, and environments. For participants, cumulative experiences and study of wildfire over time embeds ways of knowing in the context of previous methods of recalibration. Participants across all three interview groups engage in similar kinds of processual sensemaking regarding loss, transformation of the landscape, and future uncertainty, manifesting in an acceptance of what I call ecologies of impermanence. The geographer Caitlin DeSilvey, grappling with the impermanence of a disappearing coastal path in Cornwall in the U.K., similarly refers to "developing alternative ways of approaching foundered things, and allowing them to carry on with their changes with their ambiguous energies intact" [@desilveyFounderedOtherObjects2020: 226]. Research participants, as part of making sense of material reconfigurations through fire and flood, largely attribute the destruction of lives, property, and landscapes to the forces of nature. I argue that this perception of nature as agentive enable participants to grapple with different kinds of loss &mdash; physical, affective, and environmental, among them &mdash; by normalizing loss within an ecological understanding of wildfire and post-fire flooding. This is the case even though the CPF was the most extreme wildfire the majority of participants had ever experienced. Across the three groups, participants express acceptance of our inability to control wildfire. For scientists and some practitioners, lack of control is not equated with lack of agency. Agency is expressed as an articulation of values defining a vision of ecological priorities. More specifically, extreme wildfires and climate change may be transforming forested landscapes in the western U.S., but we can choose where to implement actions toward a particular ecological vision based on what we value in those landscapes. Recalibration is born out of cumulative sensemaking, indicating that people can cope with significant personal and environmental changes wrought by wildfire by engaging in processes of sensemaking over time, sensemaking which is shaped by acknowledging that matter is agential and constitutes the "ongoing reconfigurings of the world" [@baradMeetingUniverseHalfway2006: 141].

This paper explores how people make sense of a particular kind of wildfire. I conceptualize wildfire as a convergence of the multiple materialities, temporalities, and agencies of ecologies, terrain, weather, climate, and human actors, the confluence of which makes every wildfire unique. Wildfire can have both constructive and destructive properties (Fowler 2021), and landscapes across the American West are fire-adapted, meaning that wildfire is an ecological necessity (Lotan 1976; Fitzgerald 2005; Prichard et al. 2021). In the case of the CPF, the convergence of factors resulted not just in a wildfire, but in a "conflagration" [@macleanYoungMenFire1992: 289], a term I use to signify a wildfire exhibiting extreme characteristics &mdash; high rate of spread, high burn severity, and unpredictable behavior &mdash; which is beyond human capacity to control, that is also a disaster, meaning one which has negative social-ecological impacts affecting people's lives. I build on but diverge from the definition of extreme wildfire events [@tedimDefiningExtremeWildfire2018], based on fire behavior, unpredictability, and lack of capacity to control, and from megafires [@kodasMegafireRaceExtinguish2017; @swainEraMegafiresCrisis2018], typically characterized by scale, intensity, and devastation, to focus on the lived experiences of people in a particular landscape context. In using the term conflagration, inspired by Maclean's multidecadal meaning-making of the Mann Gulch Fire, I am interested in capturing the idea and experience of a wildfire existing outside normative expectations alongside its complex consequences for people's lives. I employ the concept of *overtime* to theorize how conflagrations represent a social-ecological system that is over capacity, operating in climatic overtime, that is, outside the historic range of variability.

In what follows below, I contextualize the CPF and the 2020 fire year within the literature on extreme wildfires and review anthropological engagements with landscape, temporality, and materiality to frame how people understand their own lives and experiences within the different timescales and lifecycles of human and other than human ecologies in the formation of disaster. I explore previous scholarship on sensemaking in wildfire, disaster, and heritage contexts. I describe my landscape-based methodology and, drawing on sustained ethnographic engagement with the upper Poudre Canyon community in northern Colorado, I offer empirical examples of how community members, practitioners, and scientists are making sense of the CPF, the flooding and debris flows which came after it, and how they relate to a transformed landscape subject to the material consequences [@kosekUnderstoriesPoliticalLife2006] of fire and flood.

## The Poudre Canyon, the Cameron Peak Fire, and the 2020 Fire year

The Poudre Canyon is made up of several unincorporated communities [@LarimerCountyColorado2024], meaning that Larimer County, and its Board of County Commissioners with three elected officials, is the defacto governing body. The Poudre Canyon Fire Protection District (PCFPD) is a local government entity whose jurisdiction for emergency response and wildfire management encompasses the entire populated length of the Poudre Canyon [@Us2024]. The river corridor itself is made up of 85% federal lands, with only 2,000 out of 25,000 acres in private ownership [@CachePoudreWild1990] and is where most of the houses of 750 full-time and 1,500 part-time residents are distributed [@Us2024]. The lands beyond the corridor are primarily owned by the US Forest Service (USFS). Private lands are mostly situated along the river where flatter ground makes it easier to build, although in the lower Poudre a few, comparatively newer, houses have been built on ridgelines. Alluvial fans formed many of these flatter areas, and in other cases they are part of the river's old floodplain, illustrating the dynamic fluvial properties of the Poudre in its geomorphological formations. In populated areas of the Poudre, some of the river's thousands of miles of tributaries pass through private lands in their lowest reaches before reaching the river. The largest population clusters in the Poudre today reflect historic colonial settlement patterns, built in proximity to a creek and on land where they could ranch or mine. This topography, formed by thousands of years of geologic movement, combined with land use and ownership established over shorter timescales, help shape how people in the Poudre experience wildfire and post-fire flooding.

The CPF began on August 13, 2020, in a high elevation, subalpine forested area at the top of the canyon during a year of significant drought characterized by hot, dry weather, low snowpack, and early runoff, among other variables [@bolingerClimateChangeColorado2024]. These subalpine forests experienced significant tree mortality stemming from a series of large bark-beetle outbreaks 15-25 years ago [@rodmanEffectsBarkBeetle2021]. The Poudre River flows through the canyon for forty miles, dropping thousands of feet in elevation as it makes its way toward the plains and supplies water for the hundreds of thousands of people in the populous Front Range cities of Fort Collins and Greeley. Prior to the High Park Fire (HPF) in 2012 and the CPF in 2020, the entire length of the Poudre was heavily forested, with diverse forest types following elevational gradients.

In discussing why the CPF and other fires in 2020 can be characterized as particularly extreme, it is worth noting that there is an ongoing history of small fires in the Poudre Canyon based on a combination of what participants told me, my own memories over the course of my life, and my experiences as a volunteer with the PCFPD. There is also a record of wildfires in the general area dating from 1893 [@schneiderForestFiresPoudre2020], a year in which a large, destructive, out of control fire occurred [@fryCachePoudreRiver1954]. One of the interview participants recalled the same person who recounted the 1893 wildfire as saying we were due for another one sometime in the 1940s or 1950s, indicating an expectation at that time that recurring wildfire is inherently part of this landscape. The first wildfire in the area in people's memories today that could be characterized as a conflagration occurred in 2012 in the lower Poudre and several nearby communities, destroying 259 homes [@HighParkFire2012] and causing significant flooding in nearby tributaries. Based on an interview with a PCFPD firefighter who lived in the lower Poudre at the time, the post-fire flooding took community members and Larimer County by surprise, marking the first time residents and emergency managers in this part of Colorado became familiar with the cascading hazards of fire and post-fire flooding.

It was another eight years before the Poudre Canyon experienced a significant wildfire, and it occurred in a historic year for wildfires across the American West and Pacific Northwest in 2020 [@robbinsOregonClimateChange2021; @keeleyLargeCaliforniaWildfires2021]. It is also worth noting that the 2020 wildfires occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, complicating the logistics associated with firefighting and evacuations, and exacerbating the dangers of exposure to wildfire smoke. The wildfires in 2020 in Colorado reflect uncharacteristic, extreme, and surprising behavior in several ways. First, the state's three largest wildfires, including the CPF, all occurred in 2020, surpassing the previous record set in 2002 by the Hayman Fire at 137,760 acres [@ListColoradoWildfires2024]. Second, prior to 2002, Colorado had never had a wildfire that exceeded 100,000 acres. It was eighteen years before this occurred again, in 2020, a year in which three wildfires grew to over 100,000 acres. The CPF eventually burned over 208,000 acres. Third, the sheer size of the CPF &mdash; and other fires in 2020 &mdash; is attributable to the extreme fire spread which occurred on single day events, a phenomenon increasingly driving cumulative area burned on wildfires in the western U.S. [@coopExtremeFireSpread2022]. The CPF grew by more than 40,000 acres on Labor Day 2020 in its first major period of growth and nearly reached Fort Collins in the plains in another period of extreme fire spread in mid-October [@CameronPeakFire2020e]. These extreme fire spread events were facilitated by strong winds combined with dry fuels. Wind-driven extreme fire behavior was a characteristic of many wildfires across the West and Pacific Northwest in 2020, which, in combination with high temperatures and fuel aridity, suggest a tripartite convergence of factors influencing high severity, destructive conflagrations [@eversExtremeWindsAlter2022; @abatzoglouCompoundExtremesDrive2021] and accounting for a significant percentage of area burned [@coopExtremeFireSpread2022].

Fourth, the months during which the CPF occurred and the length of time over which it burned suggest a divergence from historical fire patterns. Typically wildfires 10,000 acres or more have occurred in June or July in Colorado [@borsumCameronPeakFire2021]. Even the destructive 2002 Hayman and 2012 High Park fires began in June and were contained in less than a month [@ListColoradoWildfires2024]. In contrast, in 2020, the CPF began in August, and two other major fires began in September and October, respectively. It is not atypical to experience snow at higher elevations in Colorado in September and October, highlighting how unusual it was for wildfires to exhibit their most destructive behavior during these months and to ignite well outside the typical summer months. The aforementioned strong wind events facilitated this divergent temporal behavior during the autumn months, predicted to occur more frequently due to climate change, particularly in California [@gossClimateChangeIncreasing2020]. Downslope wind-driven wildfires in the western U.S., frequently associated with spring and fall, rather than summer, have accounted for a large percentage of some of the most destructive fires between 1999 and 2020 and appear to be increasing in frequency [@abatzoglouDownslopeWindDriven2023]. The Marshall Fire, Colorado's most destructive wildfire, was a downslope wind-driven fire which occurred on December 30, 2021 and burned 1,000 homes in a day in suburban areas of Colorado's eastern Front Range [@doughertyMarshallFireInvestigative2023]. The CPF burned well into Colorado's winter season and lasted for 112 days from August to December 2020, well outside the historical seasonality of wildfires in Colorado [@borsumCameronPeakFire2021].

The unusual behavior of the 2020 Colorado wildfires, particularly their persistence through the autumn and beginning of winter, resulted in significant disruptions to people's lives. During the CPF, people in the upper most residential area of the Poudre Canyon were evacuated for 73 of the 112 days the fire lasted. While people were under evacuation, the power was shut off by the electric authority to prevent the fire from interacting with live power lines. People who were evacuated quickly, who were not provided the opportunity to return to their homes, or who were unaware the power would be shut off returned home to destroyed refrigerators, and in some cases, damaged floors or break-ins from bears after food rotted and melted out of refrigerators. The CPF destroyed 492 structures across sixteen communities [@coalitionforthepoudreriverwatershedCameronPeakFire]. Extreme fire spread days overwhelm firefighting resources and can leave communities unprepared to evacuate in time, as happened during a concurrent fire called the East Troublesome (ETF) in October in Colorado. One of my interview participants evacuated to a hotel due to the CPF &mdash; because of COVID-19, hotels were used instead of evacuation centers &mdash; described the parking lot filled with so many evacuees from the ETF, some with nothing but the clothes they were wearing, that it was impossible to walk from the parking lot to the hotel.

The 2020 Colorado and western U.S. wildfires represent a series of conflagrations which overwhelmed the senses and capacities for those experiencing and managing the CPF to predict and respond to extreme, rapidly changing, and hazardous conditions. Subsequent fire years in other locales in the U.S. and Canada indicate similarly overwhelmed fire management capacities, such as the aforementioned 2021 Marshall Fire, the 2023 fire in Lahaina, Maui which killed 102 people and destroyed over 2,200 structures, and the record-breaking Canadian wildfires in 2023 which spanned multiple provinces, evacuated the entire town of Yellowknife in the Northwestern Territories, and caused hazardous levels of wildfire smoke to linger in New York City for days. Emerging from participant narratives of sensemaking in the aftermath of the CPF, I build on Adriana Petryna's idea of "ethnographic concept work" to imagine how communities contending with disaster-driven loss and climatic uncertainty might better navigate changing materialities and conditions of *overtime*. Petryna refers to "runaway change" in the context of wildfires and climate change writ large, representing the gap between expectations and reality, where change occurs outside the scope of projected models and predictive capacity [@petrynaWildfiresEdgesScience2018].

Although until now, I have focused primarily on conflagrations themselves as the basis for sensemaking, interviews with research participants and my experiences as a participant observer residing in a post-fire landscape reveal that wildfire and watershed hazards and the environmental changes wrought by both are inextricably linked, both ecologically [@wilsonConnectivityPostfireRunoff2021] and experientially. I advocate for conceptually connecting fire and post-fire affective and material dimensions as an acknowledgement of fire as a phenomenon which sets in motion a series of social and ecological processes with long term implications. For those community members I interviewed, experiences of post-fire repercussions are delineated from those which occurred during the fire, but the fire is characterized as the origin point, without which nothing else that followed would have occurred. I use the language of fire and post-fire to distinguish these two periods from each other in order to address the ways an active wildfire functionally impacts people's lives differently than the post-fire period. The latter period is conditioned by fire and characterized by more nebulous time horizons and distinct government response mechanisms. The reality of connected, unfolding consequences stemming from the CPF resists the idea of episodic timeframes [@shneidermanFramingIssuesPolitics2014] representing fire and post-fire periods at the same time that it is important to draw meaningful distinctions between the two to reflect the experientially different states of emergency and protraction. The ongoing landscape changes initiated by extreme wildfires &mdash; particularly in mountainous watersheds like the Poudre Canyon &mdash; and the impacts these changes have for people's lives, persists for years after the wildfire. Just as the presence of wildfires in the western U.S. indicate that we live in fire-prone landscapes, post-fire hydrological changes reveal past and potential processes of sedimentation, erosion, and deposition [@robichaudQuantifyingLongtermPostfire2020; @sosa-perezWildfireEffectsRoad2017]. Thus, making sense of conflagrations cannot be disentangled from recalibrating our understanding of landscape change also based on post-fire disturbances. By way of example, for the first three summers after the CPF, flooding and debris flows in the Poudre Canyon caused damage to roads, bridges, and homes, sometimes blocking access to property. Tragically, a debris flow in Black Hollow Creek in July 2021 killed four people and destroyed six homes. In the Poudre Canyon, some people were impacted more by either the wildfire or post-fire flooding, and some were significantly impacted by both. People's contingent experiences of fire and flood are reflected in their processes of sensemaking.

## Theorizing Landscape

### The Material Traces of Landscapes

This research addresses how lived experiences of disaster impact how people relate to the social, political, historical, and environmental landscapes in which they live and work. Building on earlier scholarship in anthropology and geography theorizing landscape, I understand landscapes as "spatial and temporal fields…co-constituted by the structure and dynamics of environments and by human action" [@morrisonPuttingTimeIts2016: 621]. Landscape is a useful theoretical concept for understanding wildfire because it represents the underlying processes of inhabitance and the relations with the plant and animal species and climatic systems encountered within, through, and on it [@braceHumanGeographiesClimate2010: 289]. A wildfire fundamentally alters these relations and renders visible the "material legacies" [@tsingWhenThingsWe2019: 230] of particular landscapes, both through fire itself and through processes initiated by the wildfire [@wohlBiogeomorphicInfluencesRiver2022], such as flooding.

The theory of punctuated equilibria was developed in 1972 to describe biological evolution in geological time [@elredgePunctuatedEquilibriaAlternative1972]. The theory explains that species tend to originate in punctuated geological moments and then remain stable for much of their evolutionary existence [@gouldPrimaryClaimsPunctuated2009]. Since then, the theory has been applied to human biocultural evolution [@obrienPunctuatedEquilibrium50], public policy changes [@jonesThereHerePunctuated2012], and environmental change [@wohlRhythmsChangeRocky2016]. Fluvial geomorphologist Ellen Wohl refers to "punctuated rhythms" to describe how changes to the landscape tend to occur during episodic periods of rapid shifts, precipitated by, for example, the melting of glaciers [@wohlRhythmsChangeRocky2016]. These periods of change occur on different timescales depending on the disturbance. In mountain watersheds, wildfire, which can occur frequently depending on species' fire regimes and fire management, represents one of these punctuations. Wildfire creates a "disturbance cascade" [@wohlBiogeomorphicInfluencesRiver2022: 1] resulting in more water and sediment being transported to the river [@wellsEffectsFireGeneration1987] and an increased likelihood of debris flows [@hochHydrogeomorphicRecoveryTemporal2021; @rengersLandslidesWildfireInitiation2020].

Wildfires reveal both that landscapes circumscribe particular patterns &mdash; an alluvial fan indicates where sediment deposition may occur again &mdash; and are unfinished [@cresswellLandscapeObliterationPractice2003] and "open to emerging forms and possibilities". The materialisms of landscapes shape and are shaped by the "lived material practices" of human beings, manifested as the "consequential materialisms" of the histories and politics of nature "enabling certain understandings and narratives" [@kosekUnderstoriesPoliticalLife2006: 284] of landscapes and constricting others. Recognizing the sociopolitical and environmental co-constitutiveness of landscapes conceptualizes the material world as both animate and imbued with agency, represented by flows, processes, and substances [@ingoldBeingAliveEssays2011], which is particularly illustrative of its relevance for exploring the Poudre Canyon. It's a landscape shaped by past and continuous movement, from its creation as a glacier- and river-formed valley to its network of tributaries through which nutrients and silt and the traces of old mining operations are mobilized along their way to join the Poudre River, to its history of fire suppression by forest managers and its elevationally-distributed forested, fire-adapted ecosystems.[^4] For those whose lives intersected with the CPF, the fire disrupted perceived ecological stability and made the world more visible as "a dynamic process of intra-activity and materialization" [@baradMeetingUniverseHalfway2006, p. 140].

### The Temporal Interventions of Wildfire

Wildfires are the result of a convergence of different scalar and temporal ecological [@pausasBurningStoryRole2009], meteorological, climatic [@higueraRecordsettingClimateEnabled2021] and anthropomorphic processes, interacting with terrain [@nealeEternalFlameElemental2019] that condition the possibility of their existence and shape the nature of their outcomes. Coming to understand how these processes spatially intervene with human timescales in the context of wildfires can help people recalibrate how they relate to the dynamic landscapes they inhabit. On account of climate change, these timescales are rapidly shifting and conditioning different potentials for wildfires to occur and also impacting their length, size, and severity [@gossClimateChangeIncreasing2020; @diffenbaughVerificationExtremeEvent2020; @borundaScienceConnectingWildfires2020]. Part of recalibration is not only renegotiating relationships with the material world but also with time. I build on theorizations of temporality to contextualize how experiences of fire expand our sense of time and of our place in time, through the concepts of geological time, *becoming*, and *overtime*.

The paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote about two different kinds of geological time and argued that both are necessary for understanding deep time. Time's arrow underscores the uniqueness of each moment in geological history and the significance of temporal sequencing, whereas "the metaphor of time's cycle captures those aspects of nature that are either stable or else cycle in simple repeating (or oscillating) series" [@gouldTimesArrowTimes1987: 196]. These two representations of geological time are appropriate for understanding wildfire today, and for contextualizing what wildfire can reveal about a geological past that informs material formations in the present. Along a similar vein, Marcia Bjornerud writes about how geological thinking can render timescales beyond the human lifespan more legible, what she refers to as "timefulness" [@bjornerudTimefulnessHowThinking2018], or an awareness of the earth's temporal rhythms outside our human lives. The CPF enabled people to apprehend time's cycle of wildfire &mdash; and flooding &mdash; as naturally recurring phenomena in the Poudre Canyon. One woman I spoke with discussed the dissonance between relying on knowledge accumulated over 100 years of inhabitance to determine flood risk for her house versus new found geological knowledge realizing that her house was built on an alluvial fan, indicating prior patterns of flooding and the possibility of its recurrence. Time's arrow points to the "contingent moments of complex historical pathways" [@gouldTimesArrowTimes1987: 196], the convergences of policy, land use, climate, and weather that led to the CPF burning when and where it did. In the post-fire reckoning , participants spoke about contributing factors to the CPF, both those factors occurring on shorter timescales, such as the hot, dry weather that fall, and on longer timescales, such as the density and distribution of beetle-killed trees in the area where it started. 

The anthropologist Townsend Middleton, researching declining quinine plantations in India, writes about the particular temporalites emergent from ruins, what he calls the "becoming-after,"in the unmakings and potential remakings" [@middletonBecomingLivesPoliticsQuinines2021: 287] of material worlds. Middleton theorizes *becoming* as leaving open possible futures. For those living, working, and researching in the Poudre, experiencing the CPF widened the aperture of both past and future temporalities, and of the material processes which came before and what might become in the future. We tend to assess what is possible in the future by what we have known in the past [@desilveyMakingSenseTransience2012], but the past can become more knowable through experiences of punctuated moments in ecological time.  In places like the Poudre Canyon, with long histories of inhabitance and strong attachment to place, environmental changes [@berroetaPlaceSubjectivityContinuum2021; @crateSakhaAlaasPlace2021] or "shock events" [@schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020: 239] like the CPF create a "temporal rupture, manifesting as dissonance between past experiences, present realities and future ideas of sociality and sense of self in place" [@asklandLivedExperiencesEnvironmental2018: 18].

Although labor capacity in firefighting were not the focus of my research, it is a germane to discussions of systems operating over capacity, or in *overtime*. Wildland firefighting hourly pay was only recently increased to $15 an hour [@FactSheetSupporting2022], and for many years firefighters have relied on overtime to make enough money for survival. Fuels treatment work, which requires similar levels of training, does not come with the overtime firefighting does. This, combined with lack of affordable housing, results in a labor shortage for wildfire prevention work such as thinning and prescribed burning (personal communication with a fire manager, 11/13/23), work which may help mitigate the effects of extreme wildfires [@chambersReviewFuelTreatment2024]. At the same time, because wildfire seasons are longer, firefighters are working for longer periods of time. The labor of wildland firefighting is one indication of a social-ecological system operating in overtime, an occupational response to wildfires which are outside our capacity to control which have consequences for individuals and communities and the landscapes they inhabit to which we lack responsive capacity in either the short or long term. The concept of *overtime* can help situate conflagrations in the wider context of climate change, in which we may be living in a world over time in the sense of the conditions necessary to prevent widespread climate catastrophe.

My research examines the importance of landscape-level experiences of temporality in relation to the material formations of weather, terrain, wildfire, and hydrology in the context of the CPF. My research findings show that meaning-making in the wake of a conflagration can take the form of a more expansive understanding of the different temporalites associated with ecological and geological lifeworlds. Potawatomi philosopher Kyle Whyte refers to "epistemologies of coordination," polytemporal understandings of the world that enable moral responsiveness to constantly changing conditions [@whyteCrisisEpistemology2021]. Wildfire, and other large-scale landscape changes, may help reconfigure temporal orientations toward future dynamic and uncertain climates and environments [@whitingtonFingerprintBellwetherModel2013; @whyteIndigenousScienceFiction2018; @baldwinSurvivingSixthExtinction2018] and uncover a perspective of the past that helps inform the present.

## Sensemaking

Previous research on sensemaking in disaster contexts has shown that emergency managers can affect emotional response and adaptation to dangerous environments by providing messaging that shapes the stories that are told pre- and post-disaster [@hodgsonEmotionsSenseMaking2007]. It matters "which stories tell stories," Haraway writes [@harawayAnthropoceneCapitalocenePlantationocene2015: 160]. Similarly, as described in the context of post-earthquake damage assessments in Nepal, informatics about recovery and repair could better support the agency of disaster-affected citizens by incorporating sensemaking into the process [@sodenMappingSilencesReconfiguring2018]. Two studies provide insight into the deliberate use of sensemaking in pre-disaster contexts. A series of workshops in a flood-prone area of Japan identify and incorporate citizens' concerns regarding flood risk to develop a framework for community-based flood risk governance [@choiDevelopmentApplicationSensemaking2019]. How framing about forest fires by the media and environmental organizations shape differing perspectives among participants was the subject of a research project in Catalonia [@castelloFramingForestFires2019]. These studies indicate that there could be a role for intentional sensemaking practices prior to disasters to help people situate their experiences within certain frameworks to facilitate agency and recovery.

My research is instead about the unintentional processes of sensemaking which emerge post-disaster, building on existing scholarship exemplified by the following case studies. Among those in southeast Australia impacted by bushfire, interviews revealed an emergent narrative of luck in post-fire sensemaking to explain both loss during the fire and spared loss, where luck may be seen as a proxy for lack of control and agency [@eriksenExaminingPerceptionsLuck2017]. In another study, humans conceptualized nature and risk following a wildfire through social constructions influenced by material consequences of the biophysical world where nature is an actant, and perceptions are shaped by different *prompts* about everyday processes of nature, severe disturbances, and scientific discoveries, respectively [@murphyDisasterSustainabilityDance2004: 254]. This aligns with previous studies in the U.S. showing that the public recognizes fire's ecological role [@mccaffreyResearchPerspectivesPublic2012] and that increasing knowledge about ecological conditions may shape community understanding of fire management strategies [@diazLocalEcologicalKnowledge2016]. In their book on the alliances of plants, fire, and humans in the Anthropocene, Christine Eriksen and Susan Ballard contend that constructing meaning out the devastation of bushfires in Australia emerged from observations and understandings of the "cyclical processes of ruin and regrowth" [@eriksenAlliancesAnthropoceneFire2020: 7]. My research builds on scholarship on post-disaster sensemaking and the significance of public understanding of fire as an ecological agent while acknowledging that epistemological and ontological understandings of fire, ecology, and loss are culturally mediated. I suggest that people constructed meaning out of the landscape changes resulting from the CPF and subsequent flooding and reconciled losses associated with these changes through their perception of the "agential realism" [@baradMeetingUniverseHalfway2006: 132] of the material world. In other words, for those I interviewed, the process of coming to terms with different kinds of loss associated with wildfire is rooted in contextualizing impermanence within an ecological framework.

Realizations of impermanence are strongly linked with engagements with sensemaking, illustrated through examples in this paper and in other scholarship. Experiences of impermanence, with its lineage in Buddhism, is explored in a transdisciplinary edited volume discussing future uncertainty in different contexts [@geismarImpermanenceExploringContinuous2022]. In a special issue of the *International Journal of Heritage Studies* on "anticipating loss" in heritage contexts, the authors discuss the adaptive strength of relinquishment and a reconceptualization of loss as inevitable change, which allows for the possibility of rejuvenation out of ruin [@desilveyAnticipatingLossRethinking2020]. Witnessing dynamic landscape changes post-fire can help us to see, for example, that "soil undoubtedly arises by destruction" because it is the product of eroding rocks [@gouldTimesArrowTimes1987, p. 77]. Accepting ecologies of impermanence, as I refer to it in the context of sensemaking around the CPF, is tied up with a recalibrated understanding of material agency through experiences of landscape as the "intertwining of trajectories" [@masseyLandscapeProvocationReflections2006, p. 46].

In this paper, I outline various stages of sensemaking in the aftermath of the CPF, stages which exist contemporaneously, indicating the processual, rather than chronological, nature of making meaning out of loss, landscape changes, and lived experiences of uncertainty [@sword-danielsEmbodiedUncertaintyLiving2018]. These stages represent a series of recalibrations, in relation to past wildfires, present and future conflagrations, risk assessment, reconciliation with loss, orienting toward patterns and cycles, and defining values.

## Methods

This research is rooted in ongoing ethnographic fieldwork beginning in 2022 and comprising three main methodological elements: participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and using landscape as a lens of analysis connecting different kinds of meaning-making related to wildfire, temporality, and materiality.

Over the course of more than two years residing in the upper Poudre, I participated in activities such as social events, community association and fire board meetings, Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) planning meetings, and site visits to private property and USFS lands impacted by wildfire or flooding. As a volunteer with the PCFPD, I learned about emergency response in a rural, unincorporated, mountainous area and how the fire district operates in relation to other emergency response and fire management agencies across different jurisdictions. I attended conferences on wildland fire and natural hazards, joined educational tours and citizen science initiatives coordinated by local nonprofits, and participated in chipping and burning slash for neighbors.

I conducted fifty semi-structured interviews with community members (20), wildland fire, emergency and watershed management practitioners (19), and scientists (11) whose studies intersect with ecological, geological, or social aspects of wildfire, post-fire flooding, or recovery. Although most community members reside in the upper Poudre and were interviewed about their experiences of the CPF, four reside in proximity to the Poudre and were interviewed about their experiences of other wildfires, in addition to the CPF. Seven practitioners are also current or former community members. Among the interviews with scientists, twelve also included open-ended conversations while walking in the CPF burn scar or accompanying researchers doing scientific fieldwork, a kind of walking interview [@evansWalkingInterviewMethodology2011; @carpianoComeTakeWalk2009]. In addition to interviews, I also used the go-along method [@kusenbachStreetPhenomenologyGoEthnographic2003] to accompany three different teams of researchers in four wildfire-impacted watersheds during their fieldwork, and seven scientists and fire/watershed managers within areas of the CPF burn perimeter. Subject matter experts engage in sensemaking, too, both through the lens of their knowledge production and their own personal experiences with fire and forests and flood. These walks were a window into their work and their worldviews. All of these field-based interactions with subject matter experts moving through areas diversely affected by fire opened up new ways for me to see and experience post-wildfire landscapes, a recalibration of my previous knowledge holdings. I identified participants by meeting them at community events, conferences, and other events, through literature reviews, and snowball sampling.

Interviews with all three groups consisted of open-ended questions loosely organized around how participants were making sense of the CPF and everything that came after it. Interviews were primarily conducted in person, with twelve conducted over Zoom and one over the phone, and lasted between 45 minutes and two hours. All interviews were voluntary and conducted and recorded with the consent of all participants. All except six interviews were recorded. Transcribed interviews were indexed in NVIVO around the broad theme of sensemaking and then further analyzed using analytic memos to draw out more specific, conceptual themes [@deterdingFlexibleCodingIndepth2021].

All participants' identities are anonymized and categorized into three groups representing community members, scientists, and practitioners. The practitioners who are also community members are grouped into the former category. When citing participants, I identify them by the first letter of these three categories: C, S, or P. For the scientists and practitioners quoted in the Results section, this is followed by the first letter of a generalized jurisdiction identifier representing federal, state, county, fire district, university, and nonprofit. A cited interview participant who is a scientist with the Rocky Mountain Research Station, for example, would be identified as SF, representing a scientist who works at the federal level, followed by the interview date. Those practitioners who are also community members are identified as the former. Table \@ref(table:ch4Table1) shows interview participant roles for scientists and practitioners, their respective organizations, and the jurisdiction of those organizations.

```

During the first year of my field-based research from June 2022 to June 2023, I lived in my extended family's newly constructed home, surrounded by fire-impacted land in all directions. Throughout the course of that year, I witnessed multiple floods and debris flows both in the creek which courses its way toward the river not far from our house and in multiple drainages off the steep mountainside to the south of the house. I documented the emergence of vegetation, insects, birds, and other wildlife, some of it new since the CPF, like the Lewis's Woodpecker, and some of it pre-existing but in a different form, like the burned mature aspen trees being replaced by thousands of aspen saplings. Part of my methodology involved situating my ethnographic research in this landscape, and being a participant observer not only of the human relations in the Poudre Canyon but also of the more than human material world [@tsingWhenThingsWe2019], rendered dynamic and emergent by the wildfire.

## Results: Making Sense of the Cameron Peak Fire Conflagration and Post-fire Disturbances

Throughout this section, I quote liberally from participants across all three groups for each category of sensemaking, using their words to articulate processes of sensemaking and recalibrated understandings of wildfire which emerge from those processes. Here I am following Sherry Ortner in a particular kind of ethnographic representation, by allowing the voices of participants themselves to affectively shape the reader's experience, what Ortner calls "critical documentary ethnography" [@ortnerSubjectsCapitalFragment2002: 10]. My approach differs slightly in that I provide considerable context, and sometimes commentary, between quotations.

## *Asbestos Forests*: Recalibrating Past Experiences of Wildfire

Community members, scientists, and practitioners alike have been developing a different understanding of Colorado's relationship to wildfire over the last couple of decades in response to changing fire behavior. Northern Colorado specifically did not experience a conflagration until the HPF in 2012. Colorado, and the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest spanning the Poudre Canyon and surrounding areas, had been known in the 1990s and early 2000s as "asbestos forests" (SF, 1/24/23; PC, 4/4/23).

> I went to a conference about ten years ago where they said in the ’90s, foresters would say, "...Colorado has asbestos forests. ...Colorado never burns.” ...The people that were...working in the ‘90s, their viewpoint was going back to what? Maybe...the ’50s. How far was their reach back? They just had this feeling, “Fires are not something we need to worry about too much in Colorado.” And then anybody that's grown up in Colorado in the 2000s goes, “Oh, burns here every year.” ...So, there's a difference in what's happening, and it’s...on the landscape in Colorado and throughout the West. ...it's just burning more (SF, 1/24/23).

One participant whose family first settled in this part of the Poudre Canyon in 1894 expressed that the HPF and the CPF were unlike other wildfires he remembered over the course of his lifetime and since he became a volunteer firefighter, temporal rhythms of fire to which he had become accustomed. Talking about the CPF, he said:

> I was surprised when it blew up, because usually, you know, most of the fires that we've had up here in my lifetime, you know, they haven't been catastrophic, huge. ...There's been a couple up in Redfeather or up along Pingree Hill. There was one when I was a kid at the Laramie River Tunnel. That was in the 60s, and then there was another one back in the 80s, I think. They were fires, but they...were in the forest, and they...only lasted a couple weeks, and they had them out. They'll have it out, and don't worry about it (C, 10/5/22).

Just as it used to be thought that Colorado forests never burned, post-fire flooding and debris flows were uncommon enough in the state following wildfires that Larimer County did not expect flooding to occur following the HPF in 2012. A firefighter with the PCFPD at the time had moved to the Poudre from California and anticipated not only large wildfires in this state at some point but also predicted that there would be flooding following the HPF, which heavily affected his fire district (PFD, 2/3/2023). Debris flows were unknown in Colorado until the mid-1990s when the geologist Susan Cannon began noticing them following the South Canyon Fire in 1994, whereas they had been studied in California since the 1930s. The study of erosion resulting from wildfire, the subject of one participant's doctoral dissertation, was still novel in 2014 (SF, 1/24/23).

> The High Park Fire was definitely a wake-up call to the municipalities and CDOT [Colorado Department of Transportation] and landowners when...the monsoon rains came through and Highway 14 was getting...giant debris flows, especially lower down. Having to shut off their intake structures, that was something that they never had to do before because we just have never had a fire that scale (PN, 8/14/23).

Input provided by participants indicates that first, until the 2000s, the presence of wildfire on the landscape in Colorado was perceived as either being largely absent or small and controllable. Second, it shows that our understanding of the relationship between wildfires, particular landscapes, and understanding of post-fire hydrological processes is shaped by our own experiences of it, within the temporal frame of our own lifetimes. Conflagrations, in the sense in which I have defined them, are a relatively recent phenomenon in Colorado, as is the expectation that flooding commonly follows wildfire, initiating processes of recalibration in real time across all three participant groups.

### *I Don't Know What I Believe in Anymore*: Reorienting to Conflagrations

The majority of participants across all three groups expressed an understanding that some of the wildfires we are experiencing today, like the CPF, and will continue to experience into the future, will be more like conflagrations and less like wildfires over which we can gain control. Some spoke about their process of coming to terms with this over time, such as this participant who described hearing from a colleague in the aftermath of the HPF, who had long been a fire practitioner in various roles, most recently for Larimer County in this story. The colleague mentions mitigation, which refers to removing potential fuels from around and adding protective elements &mdash; like a metal roof &mdash; to homes to reduce the likelihood that they will catch fire when a wildfire moves through.

> He talked about seeing homes on fire where he himself had done the mitigation work. And he said, "We followed all the guidelines with all the Firewise and defensible space and all those things, and I'm sitting there, and I'm literally watching the work that I've done go up in flames." And he said, "I don't even know what that means. I don't know what I believe in anymore." It was very nihilistic (RU, 10/6/22).

A few participants, also across all three groups, described believing a fire like the CPF was inevitable because of a multitude of factors ranging from a history of fire suppression to drought to climate change writ large, even while personally experiencing the CPF as outside normative expectations. One federal employee involved in CPF fire management said:

> I think it's really hard to work in that space over the last 20 years and not see that events like that are becoming inevitable. We've certainly been in drought for a number of years. So it definitely felt like it was a matter of time.
> ...We'd be meeting with these teams, and they'd be like...the model shows that's just a 2% chance. And I was like, I'm going to get a t-shirt that says we're in the 2%, 100% of the time. ...Every time we would sort of get this conversation about, well, let's plan for what's probably going to happen and not what might happen. It was like, no, what might happen is what's happening every...couple weeks. That's what's happening (PF, 11/13/23).

Others' expectations regarding wildfire today are shaped by their disciplinary backgrounds as fire, forest, or landscape ecologists, which enable them to understand wildfire within the context of timeframes defined by fire histories or the life histories of certain tree species. Referring to what he called megafires, one participant said:

> They are outside the evolutionary history of most of the forest in the Western United States...in the coastal states and all across the South, in the Gulf states and so on. Being outside the evolutionary history means you're working without a net, right? If you're within the evolutionary history of the biota, then there are self-regulatory mechanisms that come into play to help right the system if it gets out of whack (RU, 8/21/23).

Wildland firefighters I spoke with had perspectives informed by the diversity of wildfires they have experienced in terms of scale and severity over the course of their careers. The record-breaking size of the CPF for Colorado was not in and of itself shocking. One, who has worked as a smokejumper, hotshot, and in emergency services, described a 280,000-acre wildfire in Alaska he was assigned to in 2015, along with only seven other people, and about which most people have never heard. In the lower forty-eight states, it would have been a historic fire with millions of dollars expended every day. He has been hearing the word unprecedented to characterize every fire season for the last sixteen years. He did, however, describe a feeling of disbelief when he learned the ETF had jumped over the continental divide, a sentiment echoed by several participants. After the ETF, he concluded "anything is possible" (PC, 4/4/23).

Similarly, another participant, quoted below, who has worked for thirteen years as a hotshot spoke about each firefighting season being similar regardless of the scale of the fire. This perception coincides with the previous participant's idea that first, wildfire size is not inherently alarming, and second, that fire behavior operates over a wide range. That which we are experiencing anew in our lifetimes is not necessarily indicative of behavior outside the range even while it may be outside the range of that which we've personally experienced, such as wildfire crossing the continental divide. A study involving interviews with fire behavior analysts also reflects this perspective [@wallAreWildfiresGetting2018].

> ...Every year I've been a hotshot I've had 1,000 hours of overtime. And I doubt that's gonna change anytime soon. That's just the nature, of this type of crew and this work. It's that, wherever it is, there's some fire management problem to be solved somewhere, regardless of how big the fire is, or, you know, how hot its burning. And, really, all that does is change tactics (PF, 3/3/23).

The participant quoted above suggested I speak with fire practitioners who have been working in the field over two or three decades for a perspective of wildfire over a longer period of time. The participant quoted below, who has been working in firefighting since 1995, told me he became interested in working in fire management because he believed in fire and its place on the landscape, what he refers to in the passage below as good fire, or fire that is ecologically beneficial. He now questions whether good fire is still possible. This sense that wildfire is operating outside of historical pretexts was a more common perspective among participants, particularly scientists, than the perspective of the two wildland firefighters quoted above. There is some indication that those fire practitioners who have been practicing longer are also in alignment with the former perspective.

> With global warming, now I know that there's hardly any fire anymore that's not going to be too damaging, more damaging than we want to the landscape. So, that's where I'm at now. The thing I've come to by now is that it's really hard to have any good fire anymore. It's just the conditions are not...allowing it (PF, 12/4/22).

The predominant sentiment expressed by participants is that wildfires are becoming more severe and unpredictable. Those who study fire or forest ecology or who have worked in wildland firefighting over long periods situate this sentiment in observed or experiential changes over time or in the empirical findings resulting from their research. Some fire practitioners, particularly those working over the last fifteen years or so, are less prone to characterize fire behavior today as outside the norm.

### *I Feel Like There's No Such Thing as Control*: Grappling with Risk

There is widespread accord across the three groups in characterizing and accepting wildfire and/or post-fire flood risk. For many, this is based on their experiences with the CPF or other wildfires and subsequent flooding events. Some also spoke about a misplaced understanding of risk, most commonly in relation to flooding, where before post-fire flooding occurred, the Poudre River was perceived to be the greatest threat. In fact, the greatest danger after the CPF came from the river's tributaries. Only the river's floodplain is delineated in official maps, contributing to the idea that the river, and not the tributaries, represents the greatest hazard. Previous major regional flooding events, including extensive flooding in 2013 of the Poudre River and Big Thompson River, largely affected communities in the foothills and plains and in nearby Big Thompson Canyon, all events which reinforced the idea of flood danger from the rivers themselves. One participant in her early 90s remembered two floods on the Poudre River over the course of her lifetime which destroyed the bridge over the river to her family's home. My mother remembers a flood in 1955 on the tributary near our old house, which sent water and sediment into the house and eroded the roads, but this flood sixty-five years before CPF was the only time in living memory the creek flooded until the first summer after the fire. This memory from a person who was ten years old at the time did not translate into a broad understanding that tributaries can present life-threatening danger.

One person whose family lost their cabin in the Black Hollow debris flow reflected on this disconnect:

> It's just not at all what would have been imagined, that it would be Black Hollow Creek that would flood. ...If the Poudre River flooded, we were safe, because we're higher on the hill... But nobody considered the possibility that the devastation of Black Hollow Creek, which had always been this super tiny, three-foot-wide creek, would...expand into...a...twenty-foot-wide crevice now. That's just not something that anybody could fathom... (C, 11/29/22).

Multiple community members, some of them also practitioners, spoke about wildfire and nature as agentive, cleansing forces dealing with unhealthy forests, contextualizing wildfire risk within its ecological role on the landscape. For many people, the vast areas of beetle-killed forests at higher elevations were deemed unhealthy, and in some cases, an example of forest mismanagement or of bowing to pressure from environmentalists who wanted forests left alone. This perception may have contributed to an idea of the fire as cleansing. One person described the CPF and the Black Hollow debris flow this way:

> Just like your mom telling you, if you don't clean your room, I'm going to clean it for you. ...we didn't clean our room, so she came in and cleaned it for us. And to a certain extent the flood was kind of the same thing. It was like, okay, I got to mop the floor now. It was a little bit of cleaning up. Mother Nature. I mean, I'm a Christian, I believe in God, and there's a purpose behind everything. But the Mother Nature aspect of cleaning things up and the earth taking care of itself (C, 10/5/22).

For a number of community members, for whom there existed varying levels of awareness of wildfire risk before experiencing the CPF or other wildfires, this awareness was amplified afterwards. The consequences for people's lives of experiencing a conflagration like the CPF resulted in an attitude of acceptance of risk in relation to living in a fire-prone area and an acceptance of lack of control over wildfire and its consequences. One community member who emerged from a multi-week hiking trip in another part of the state to learn her home was under mandatory evacuation said:

> I feel like there's no such thing as control. We have this false sense of feeling like we're in control of our lives. I'm at a point in my life where I'm like...life happens, something could happen to me if I live in town, something could happen to me if I'm here. I have different risks and challenges here than I have in town, or that I have in different parts of the country or...the world. If I live over here, it's going to be hurricanes, if I live over here it's going to be tornadoes, if I live over here it's gonna be drought. You know, I have water I can drink, I have temperatures in the summer where I don't need air conditioning. So, I think anywhere you live there's going to be trade-offs (C, 12/20/2022).

The idea of lack of control, along with a certain level of unpredictability in relation to wildfire and post-fire flooding, is echoed by scientists and practitioners. There are ways we can try and reduce our vulnerability to experiencing conflagrations and consequential flooding events, such as thinning fuels and implementing prescribed burns in strategic locations close to communities or in high value watersheds &mdash; where the value is defined by the use of those watersheds for drinking water supply. However, "when the weather conditions get really severe, all the best laid plans can be not enough" (SU, 8/3/23). An emergency manager described her perspective on uncertainty based on her training and experience in her field this way:

> I'm a student of chaos theory, and chaos theory says we can't predict really what's going to happen... There are patterns... One thing that we know is the fire season is lengthened. We're going to have greater flood events because more water will come down at one time. ...we know this stuff because of changes in climate. I don't think for me there's more uncertainty just because I kind of know that this stuff is going to happen. I'm one of those people who believes bad things happen to everybody (PC, 9/20/23).

A social scientist who has been studying wildfire for over two decades expressed that she would like to communicate to fire managers a sentiment I heard from other scientists as well:

> If I could magically wave a wand, if I could magically change the attitude, I would change it from...you guys don't control fire. You can help manage it and direct it. You don't control it. It's always going to win. Just give up this idea that you control it. You don't control nature. But, you know, for a long time, they could. So that's given them this illusion that they do. And so, anything that helps create a comfort level around lack of control to me is a really good thing (SF, 7/9/23).

Speaking about the public, she said:

> And there's evidence of...you know, people can deal with this stuff pretty good. ...they can make sense out of it. They can deal with uncertainty. They can deal with change. It doesn't mean they enjoy it. But humans can deal with it. And I think creating more comfort around that, that's really important and really useful. ...because we've sort of given ourselves this illusion that we can eliminate uncertainty, and we can eliminate risk (SF, 7/9/23).

The idea of creating comfort around uncertainty and change relates back to the idea of embracing relinquishment in heritage contexts. Rather than being fatalistic, this perspective acknowledges that "the world is an open process of mattering through which mattering itself acquires meaning and form through the realization of di√erent agential possibilities" [@baradMeetingUniverseHalfway2006, p. 141]. Experiences with and the study of conflagrations, watersheds, and landscape ecology, shape people's understanding of landscape-related risk and uncertainty. There is a sense across all three groups that "nature is the strongest force there is in its various guises" (C, 12/29/22), which contributes to a view of nature as agentive and an acceptance of our inability to control fire. This is the case even for one participant and others with whom I spoke throughout my fieldwork, who believe that the mismanagement of forests contributed to the overall wildfire risk leading to the CPF.

### *There Had to be Some Kind of Phoenix*: Loss, Reconciliation, and Renewal

For people who live in the Poudre Canyon, the CPF and post-fire flooding are transformative experiences, tinged with loss, tragedy, and massive disruptions to their lives in the form of extended evacuations, home loss, loss of agency over their lives, and challenges with insurance claims, among many other consequences. The impacts from the CPF carry a huge emotional toll, in no small part because the landscape to which their memories are attached is completely different. For those practitioners and scientists whose areas of work are in the Poudre Canyon, whose families recreate here, and whose friends or family members live in the CPF burn area, they also had strong emotional responses to the wildfire. Participants spoke about the process of reconciliation with loss, with a transformed landscape, and how the CPF marked the end of certain things and the beginnings of others.

### *It Was Just Too Much*: Reckoning With Loss

For those who lost homes, either in the wildfire or the Black Hollow debris flow, total structure loss was accompanied by loss of place attachment associated with an altered landscape. One participant, a member of my family, described how she felt approaching the site where our historic home used to be for the first time after it burned.

> ...It was so different because of the feeling of the landscape, like the things that you know so well. ...I walked up the road. And I was emotional, but it was...right where you turn the bend, and you would normally see the fork up, and just how different it all looked. And that's when I kind of lost it. ...I don't know what it was about seeing that spot or what it was about the landscape. It was too much. That was intense (C, 9/8/23).

Those practitioners and scientists who live in Fort Collins and who live, work, or recreate in the Poudre felt a personal connection to and experienced emotional impacts from the CPF not typical of their experiences with other wildfires in places not so close to home. One participant, involved in management of the CPF, spoke about the emotional toll of the CPF for her and her staff.

> I mean, the experience of having personal texts with my neighbors about their properties up in the mountains, meeting with evacuees...these are people in the community. These are my employees, right? Who are all not only working, but experiencing that, whatever was happening with their family land or their memories from High Park. ...This isn't the first extreme event in this area. So, we definitely had people going through reliving what they had experienced, homes lost and that kind of thing during High Park (PF, 11/13/23).

Another participant, a scientist who worked for a number of years as a wildland firefighter and now studies post-fire forest regeneration in the context of climate change, described how personally she experienced the landscape changes associated with the CPF compared to other wildfires she has fought or studied. Her sentiments echoed that of community members struggling with landscape change.

> I think it's easier for me as a fire ecologist to...remove myself from the emotions of what it's like to see that transformation. But when it's in your backyard, there's not really...a way to change that entirely. You can say all you want that it's cool to have a reset of an ecosystem or new growth coming in. You still lost...all those old friends that aren't there anymore [referring to trees] (SU, 1/19/23).

While the CPF personally impacted people across the three groups in different ways, it was emotionally taxing for everyone who lives or works in proximity to the Poudre or other affected communities. Even for those who study fire or work in fire management, the CPF initiated processes of grief on a more intimate scale. Jessica O'Reilly writes about the intersection of emotion and expertise among glaciologists studying melting Antarctic ice sheets, mediated through sensory experiences on the ice. These "relationships on the borders of discipline and expertise" [@oreillySensingIceField2016, p. 28] shape predictions of future conditions of the ice sheets, just as personal experience with the CPF among practitioners and scientists initiated processes of sensemaking resulting in recalibration otherwise foreclosed to people, even those who work in wildfire-related fields.

### *The Mystery Continues*: Finding Solace in Patterns and Cycles

In spite of the sense of loss experienced by people across all three groups in relation to the CPF or the post-fire flooding which came after it, the majority of, though not all, participants, conveyed a coming to terms with their grief, with the loss of homes, with the drastic changes in a beloved landscape, or with the uncertainty of forest regeneration. This reconciliation was contextualized within ideas of impermanence and renewal for community members and some practitioners, and within the ecological history of this landscape for some scientists. Even though the CPF, ETF, and other wildfires had ecological consequences &mdash; to say nothing of social consequences &mdash; outside the historical norm, the life histories of certain plants are still playing out in expected ways. Observing landscape changes in the aftermath of a wildfire is an opportunity to experience how an ecosystem adapts &mdash; or doesn't &mdash; in response to a process it has evolved alongside. A forest ecologist, who also has a cabin in a subwatershed of the Poudre River, told me about the first wildfire &mdash; the Hourglass Fire in 1994 &mdash; after which he was able to personally observe the changes occurring over time.

> This fire was not a disturbance in the forest so much as just an event that happened. ...The forest historically had these events, and things happen after the events, and we get a forest again. I expected it would from what I'd learned and heard and read, but I'd never really had an on the ground opportunity to watch what was going here. One of my favorite stories about it is that before the fire, when we would bring students up, there was a lot of plant identification involved, and there's a kind of shrub called ceonathus or snowbrush. And it's a shrub that deer like to eat and elk like to eat, but it has a unique ability that's a lot like alfalfa where it has nodules on the roots that can enrich the soil with nitrogen. And very few plants know how to do this, so it's a plant I've always liked. And we knew where there were six of them that we could show the students for ID purposes. And its life history is that it produces all kinds of seeds, and then they lay in the soil until the next fire. So the previous fire had been 100 years before, seeds lay in the soil, and then after the '94 fire there were tens of thousands of these shrubs across the landscape. And so that was a clear sign that the fire ecologically was the kind of thing that was not an unusual long-term change in the forest landscape because these ceonathus had seen it before. They'd evolved to handle it, and here they were spreading out and then restocking the seed banks so that after the next fire, which would be this 2020 fire, I expect they'd be able to pop up again (SU, 8/3/23).

In the summer of 2024, more than three years after the CPF, I was hiking a mountain in the Poudre Canyon and came across an extensive patch of ceonathus so thick and voluminous that many are likely resprouts rather than germinated from seed after the CPF. The hundreds of densely populated trees on this mountainside had been obliterated during the CPF. Today, there's not a single living conifer tree which survived in this particular spot, although aspens are successfully resprouting in certain areas. Yet, in an uninterrupted cycle, the ceonathus is thriving, injecting the soil with life-giving nitrogen and creating a seed base to be exploited in a future wildfire. In a world in which conflagrations, combined with climate change, create more difficult conditions for survival for humans and the other than human world, "recognizing relational agency can break patterns of inevitability" [@petrynaFuturitiesRethoughtPolitical2024: 603].

One community member lost a home in their family since 1945, a cabin which was also historically significant in the settler history of the Poudre. He similarly spoke about the cycle of grief within the context of nature's cyclical patterns.

> ...Part of grieving is internalizing the memories, which is also letting them go. And so, in a sense, that can leave things unresolved. Because part of what you're dealing with in this whole business is how do we deal with grief, as well as how do we deal with life. ...To turn it around, it's as if you're experiencing nature's traumas. Because we sort of take nature for granted, even with the sense of the mystery. And then all of a sudden it looks as if it's all gone, but the mystery continues. Because it's coming back to life in its own way (C, 11/17/23).

In another example of synergism across the three groups, a longtime wildland firefighter echoed similar sentiments.

> As we go along, we learn that that is just the nature of living, right? It's that things break down, and change, and we are never perfect, and so we just have to be able to...accept that imperfection, and work with it in the best means we can, versus getting hung-up on...this isn't ideal, that we hold in our hearts and in our minds, as...the way things should be (P, 3/3/23).

Living and working in and studying wildfire-affected landscapes can provide opportunities to observe dynamic changes in vegetation, in hydrology, and in geologic movements that open different temporal windows on landscape processes. For people across the three groups, situating dramatic and traumatic wildfire-related experiences within the context of different life cycles of the material world helps reconcile these experiences as existing within patterns and timeframes beyond our human attachments.

### What Do We Value?

Scientists studying the interaction between wildfires and watersheds and forest regeneration, in particular, as well as some practitioners, identify certain challenges associated with more extreme wildfires and their repercussions, also within the context of climate change. These challenges include, among others, water quality and supply and whether certain tree species will be able to regenerate within the current climate and following high severity fire. Participants suggested a values-based approach in determining how we move forward as a society in addressing these challenges, such as this fire ecologist:

> In thinking about what are the good or the bad things about fire, it's...what're the human values that...I ascribe to a place, like I think of this place as a ponderosa pine forest. Well, if that's what you want, then you can view it as bad or decide you need to take some action to try to re-initiate a forest like that if it's not gonna come back naturally. ...I think a lot about...climate adaptation and what adaptation strategies we should be doing in post-fire and even pre-fire areas to prevent that next fire. And I think a lot of it does come back to...what is it that we want from that ecosystem, or how do we want that ecosystem to thrive? Because no, I don't want...a landscape to be replaced by all invasive species. But if it's a truly a functioning native community, then who am I to say that it should be a ponderosa pine forest instead of a grassland ecosystem if that's what's coming back naturally? But that's really hard...to think about, when you're used to it being a forest or this specific type of forest (SU, 1/19/23).

A forest ecologist also spoke about our predisposition to value the landscape in ways that are human-centric.

> If you walk through a forest, and you come to an opening, the foresters think...oh, here's a gap in the forest. Something happened here. We ought to have some trees here. But if you're a deer walking through the forest, you think, oh, thank God, I get something to eat. And so for a broad perspective on the forest, when you come out of the trees and into a meadow, it's the presence of something really, really good. It's a meadow. But if you've got this real bias towards trees, well, then it's just an absence of an opportunity where you could have had trees. So we may put some values in our hearts about forests versus meadows, but I don't think nature has those kinds of values. And if you're elk, you really like these fires. And if you're a woodpecker, you like the fires for at least 10 years afterward because that's all the food you want. But we have some choices if you'd like the landscape to be a little more like this, or make sure it doesn't go more like that. We can talk about what would be undesirable, what tools do we have in our toolkits to move away from those undesirable risks (SU, 8/3/23).

A watershed scientist spoke about how she might identify areas of concern, connecting the presence of trees in watersheds to protecting water supply and quality.

> ...sometimes it's hard to feel like going to plant a few trees here is really gonna make a difference...so, I think that deciding what to do should be really focused on identifying those potential breaking points of the system...those conditions where you no longer have enough water for the water supply, or your water quality is chronically impaired, and trying to figure out how to mitigate those tipping points (SU, 9/12/23).

A wildfire policy analyst and former wildland firefighter expressed the need to expand dialog around how we talk about living with fire.

> Plenty of people are traumatized by fire. And sure, we can talk about coexisting, but they lost so much of their livelihood or their house to it that it's...difficult for them to even get there, which is also understandable. ...I think just having more emotional conversations about where we are at, and what fire means to us and could mean to us is the only way we're going to be able to shift how we live with fire (PN, 8/1/23).

In the midst of ecological uncertainty wrought by conflagrations, especially in light of climate change, participants suggest that as a society, we both have to accept changing conditions and identify, based on what we value, those places where we can influence the trajectory of change. These insights offer guidance for policy makers, in thinking about how to adapt to changing condition and cultivating moral responsiveness [@whyteCrisisEpistemology2021] and values-based prioritization.

## Discussion

In response to increasingly severe wildfires which negatively impact people's lives, what I have termed conflagrations, I have shown that people across different constituencies engage in processes of sensemaking. The basis of this research project is to ask: what is the capacity of people to understand landscape transformations in ways that can help inform how we manage uncertainty and risk in the future associated with more extreme wildfires, flooding, and climate change? My findings suggest that people undergo processes of recalibration in response to the social, ecological, and geological disruptions caused by conflagrations that open up different ways of knowing the environment and of connecting past, present, and future landscape changes. These processes enable participants to reflect on experiences and knowledge holdings regarding wildfires of the past, extreme wildfires of the present, matters of agency and control in relation to wildfire risk, emotional pain resulting from different kinds of loss, temporal reorientation toward the material world, and future-oriented pathways based on defined values.

Like previous scholars have shown, I also found that participants across all three groups, community members, practitioners, and scientists, experience solastalgia, a form of emotional distress associated with environmental changes that disrupt perceptions of temporal continuity [@albrechtSolastalgiaDistressCaused2007; @asklandLivedExperiencesEnvironmental2018]. One person referred to this as the feeling of "camping in your own backyard" (SF, 11/21/22). What I also found, however, was that these feelings exist alongside and are sometimes tempered by practices of sensemaking which situate grief and loss within notions of impermanence, renewal, and mystery, and a perception of nature as agentive and simultaneously destructive and cleansing. The majority of my research participants, again across all constituencies, express acceptance of uncertainty and of lack of control in relation to wildfires and the forces of nature writ large, including climate change, though not all specifically mentioned the latter. My research validates what the disaster anthropologist Roberto Barrios has referred to as the post-disaster emergence of "affective ecologies" [@barriosGoverningAffectNeoliberalism2017: 6], the ways that people understand the material world through sensory and emotive experiences contextualized by cultural and political historicities.

Among the practitioners and scientists who indicated that we cannot continue to operate under the illusion that we are able to control wildfire &mdash; for which there is agreement across the three groups &mdash; and whose work or research suggests that forest regeneration is changing for certain tree species under climate change, lack of control is not necessarily associated with lack of agency. First, one way to adapt to changing climatic conditions and the ecological consequences of more extreme wildfires is to "appreciate that landscapes do change over time. And the landscapes we've grown up with for the last few decades have not been that way for very long. And they very much won't be that way in the future" (SU, 8/3/23). Locating the changes we observe and experience in landscapes today as a result of wildfire as entangled in the lifecycles of the material world beyond our human-centric timeframe is a form of adaptation and agentive thinking. We need policies, investments, and governance addressing conflagrations, disaster, and climate change which reflect this "poly-temporal worldview" [@bjornerudTimefulnessHowThinking2018]. Second, we can exert agency in an atmosphere of uncertainty by focusing efforts such as fuels treatments, watershed restoration, or tree plantings where, defined on what we value ecologically and socially, we want to see particular outcomes. One participant explained, and wrote about, an inverse approach, where stakeholders define what undesirable conditions might be instead, focusing efforts on reducing the risk associated with those conditions [@matonisBenefitsUndesirableApproach2016].

We live in a world in which extreme wildfires will surely continue to occur given local contexts of fuel, drought, heat, land use and management, and broader patterns of climate change. This paper shines a light onto processes of recalibration which shape our understanding and relations with the material world in a way that allows for broader temporal and ontological expansiveness in contending with conflagrations, post-fire flooding, and uncertain climatic futures.
