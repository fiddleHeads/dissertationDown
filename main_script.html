<!-- # Abstract -->
<!-- Remember, It can't be longer than 350 words! -->
<p>High severity wildfire and post-fire flooding can dramatically alter landscapes and disrupt people’s lives, sometimes in complex ways not readily visible to the broader public or to the naked eye. Wildfires in the western U.S., and elsewhere in the world, are becoming more destructive for communities and ecological systems. In response to the changes in how wildfires are affecting our communities and environments over roughly the last two decades, this research explores how people are reorienting to transformed lives and landscapes and coping with loss as a result of wildfire. Drawing on over two years of situated, ethnographic fieldwork in a wildfire-impacted landscape, I ask: how do people understand their own lives and experiences within the different timescales and lifecycles of human and more than human ecologies in the formation of wildfire? What capacity do we have to make sense of affective and ecological transformations wrought by wildfire and post-fire flooding? How do institutional and policy responses to wildfires shape people’s relations with different forms of governance and the environment? How do such responses affect the capacity of people to make decisions about their lives and futures? I explore these questions through an anthropological exploration in the landscapes of the upper Poudre Canyon in northern Colorado. My research highlights three main arguments. First, in mountain watersheds, we can anticipate social consequences resulting from wildfire by examining the ecological disturbance cascade it initiates. Second, state-sponsored efforts to cultivate best practices for living with wildfire risk should be more geographically and socially expansive, to acknowledge that contending with wildfire and its associated hazards of smoke and flooding is a society-wide challenge. Third, people experience a recalibration of relationship to place from engaging in processes of sensemaking in response to extreme wildfires and resultant landscape changes. This dissertation contributes to a more than human anthropology by attending to the qualities of fire and flood as they exist in a processual and relational material world through sustained ethnographic engagement with people and place.</p>

<!-- Remember, It can't be longer than 150 words! -->
<p>High severity wildfire and post-fire flooding can dramatically alter landscapes and disrupt people’s lives, sometimes in complex ways not readily visible to the broader public or to the naked eye. Wildfires in the western U.S., and elsewhere in the world, are becoming more destructive for communities and ecological systems. In response to the changes in how wildfires are affecting our communities and environments over roughly the last two decades and drawing on over two years of ethnographic fieldwork in a small mountain community in Colorado , this research explores how people make sense of dramatic changes to their lives and the landscapes in which they live. This dissertation contributes to understanding how wildfires have cascading social and ecological consequences and the mechanisms through which people come to make sense of disaster. Understanding narrative experiences and sensemaking processes can help society prepare for future wildfires and disasters.</p>

<p>High severity wildfire and post-fire flooding can dramatically alter landscapes and disrupt people’s lives, sometimes in complex ways not readily visible to the broader public or to the naked eye. Wildfires in the western U.S., and elsewhere in the world, are becoming more destructive for communities and ecological systems <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wassermanClimateInfluencesFuture2023"><strong>wassermanClimateInfluencesFuture2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-turnerMagnitudeDirectionTempo2022"><strong>turnerMagnitudeDirectionTempo2022?</strong></a>)</span>. The associated hazards of wildfire smoke, extreme heat, and post-fire flooding have increasingly dire consequences for people and the environments in which they live and on which they rely for access to clean air, water, and the values they derive from the natural world <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jackaFloodFireReorganizing2023"><strong>jackaFloodFireReorganizing2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-wilmotExpandingNumberWestern2021"><strong>wilmotExpandingNumberWestern2021?</strong></a>)</span>. In response to the changes in how wildfires are affecting our communities and environments over roughly the last two decades, this research explores how people are reorienting to transformed lives and landscapes and coping with loss as a result of wildfire. This dissertation contributes to a more than human anthropology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingMorethanHumanSocialityCall2013"><strong>tsingMorethanHumanSocialityCall2013?</strong></a>)</span> by attending to the qualities of fire and flood as they exist in a processual and relational material world <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ingoldBeingAliveEssays2011">Ingold 2011</a>)</span> through sustained ethnographic engagement with people and place.</p>
<p>Situating my research in a wildfire-impacted landscape and my research questions in landscape as a theoretical concept, I ask: how do people understand their own lives and experiences within the different timescales and lifecycles of human and more than human ecologies in the formation of wildfire? What capacity do we have — as individuals, communities, and governments — to make sense of affective and ecological transformations wrought by wildfire and post-fire flooding? How do institutional and policy responses to wildfires shape people’s relations with different forms of governance and the environment? How do such responses affect the capacity of people to make decisions about their lives and futures?</p>
<p>I explore these questions through an anthropological exploration of the post-fire, unfurling material configurations in the landscapes of the rural, unincorporated upper Cache la Poudre Canyon (hereafter Poudre Canyon or Poudre). This mountainous community in northern Colorado was one among sixteen in Larimer County impacted by the 2020 Cameron Peak Fire (CPF) and subsequent catastrophic post-fire flooding and debris flows. My own family’s historic home was destroyed in this wildfire, an experience which formed the basis for this dissertation. My research engages three groups of people in relation to the CPF: community members (primarily residing in the upper Poudre, with a handful living in the periphery); scientists who study different aspects of fire, most with study sites in the Poudre; and fire/emergency/watershed practitioners and managers. These are not discrete groups, as some people are both community members and practitioners or scientists. Through an ethnographic inquiry into how people make sense of rapid, large-scale landscape changes, my research contributes to an understanding of our relationship with social-ecological disruptions and uncertainty and how these (re)shape senses of belonging <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-adamsAnticipationTechnoscienceLife2009"><strong>adamsAnticipationTechnoscienceLife2009?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-nealeKnowingWildfireRisk2016"><strong>nealeKnowingWildfireRisk2016?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>I make three main arguments in this dissertation rooted in my research findings and outlined in separate chapters structured as journal articles. First, I propose that, in mountain watersheds, we can anticipate social consequences resulting from wildfire by examining the ecological disturbance cascade <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nakamuraDisturbanceRegimesStream2000"><strong>nakamuraDisturbanceRegimesStream2000?</strong></a>)</span> it initiates. This opens up avenues to respond to wildfire and post-fire recovery rooted in the reality of experiences which are simultaneously socially and ecologically mediated. Second, I argue that state-sponsored efforts to cultivate best practices for living with wildfire risk should be more geographically and socially expansive, to acknowledge that contending with wildfire and its associated hazards of smoke and flooding is a society-wide challenge, not just for those living in fire-adapted landscapes. Third, I suggest that people experience a recalibration of relationship to place from engaging in processes of sensemaking in response to extreme wildfires and resultant landscape changes. Recalibration which is oriented toward an ecological understanding of wildfire and post-fire flooding can help people cope with different kinds of loss caused by wildfire.</p>
<p>In this introductory chapter, I review the literature which frames my research questions and discuss how this dissertation is positioned within current scholarship. I provide a broad overview of my methodological framework and discuss my research positionality and ethical considerations, followed by a chapter overview. Each of the three subsequent chapters contains its own thematic literature review and a methods section, which I do not repeat in the introduction. Each chapter also provides information about the study area and community in which this research was conducted and describes the Cameron Peak Fire. Where I discuss these elements in the introduction, I try to avoid being redundant.</p>
<div id="theoretical-framework" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Theoretical Framework</h2>
<p>I draw on an interdisciplinary body of literature, beginning with the anthropology of disaster and literature on agency and governance within disaster and climate change contexts. I then situate my research within cross-disciplinary perspectives on climate change and the Anthropocene, followed by examining the literature within the anthropology of wildfire. Finally, I draw on theoretical approaches to temporality and materiality from geography, Indigenous epistemologies, and anthropology. The sections below outline how my research project is situated across these different literatures. I do not cover the extensive social science literature on wildfire in this section, as I discuss various aspects of this literature in Chapters 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<div id="disaster-agency-and-governance" class="section level3" number="1.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Disaster, Agency, and Governance</h3>
<p>There are four primary ways my project draws on approaches from the anthropology of disaster: attention to how disasters are socially constituted; the importance of ethnography in documenting local, embodied experiences of disaster; governance practice; and material and human agency.</p>
<p>First, since the 1970s, one of the largest contributions of anthropology and other social science disciplines to disaster studies has been to analyze disasters as both socially constructed and material events, the effects of which are distributed according to existing structural relations of power <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oliver-smithTheorizingVulnerabilityGlobalized2004"><strong>oliver-smithTheorizingVulnerabilityGlobalized2004?</strong></a>)</span>. This is important because how disasters are defined and conceptualized has significant material, affective, and cultural consequences and shapes how we respond to them <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gonzalesAfterwardPreparingUncertainties2016"><strong>gonzalesAfterwardPreparingUncertainties2016?</strong></a>)</span>. As a review of recent coverage reveals, however, disasters continue to be characterized as ‘natural’ in media <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-boisvertCanadaWasntPrepared2021"><strong>boisvertCanadaWasntPrepared2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-kleffnerInsuranceIsntEnough2022"><strong>kleffnerInsuranceIsntEnough2022?</strong></a>)</span>, and increasingly, attributed predominantly to climate change (for why this is problematic in a general sense, see <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rajuStopBlamingClimate2022"><strong>rajuStopBlamingClimate2022?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-barriosUnwieldyDisastersEngaging2019"><strong>barriosUnwieldyDisastersEngaging2019?</strong></a>)</span>). In the case of wildfires in the U.S., and specifically in the context of the CPF, it is difficult to separate the multiple contributing factors and conclude that climate change is primarily responsible. Doing so may also obscure the more specific anthropogenic contributions to increasingly damaging wildfires, both socially and ecologically <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-calkinNegativeConsequencesPositive2015"><strong>calkinNegativeConsequencesPositive2015?</strong></a>)</span>. To cite one significant example, the history of forest management practices in the U.S. included a century of fire suppression in ecosystems which had evolved to burn at varying intervals <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vanwagtendonkHistoryEvolutionWildland2007">van Wagtendonk 2007</a>)</span>. Suppression over such a long period has resulted in more fuel available to burn <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kaufmannHistoricalFireRegimes2018"><strong>kaufmannHistoricalFireRegimes2018?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Second, the unique, localized social-ecological conditions preempting each disaster suggests a continued role for anthropologists studying specific disasters to highlight the ways they constitute historically (re)produced conditions of risk <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gonzalesAfterwardPreparingUncertainties2016"><strong>gonzalesAfterwardPreparingUncertainties2016?</strong></a> 100)</span> and reflect “processes shaped by dialectical relationships between people’s actions and the material agency of the environments they inhabit” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosResilienceCommentaryVantage2016">Barrios 2016, 32</a>)</span>. My research interrogates how the production of risk in the Poudre Canyon exists within specific historical and sociopolitical contexts of human and other than human relations, or “assemblages” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingWhenThingsWe2019">A. Tsing 2019</a>: 232)</span>, in which multispecies actors enable or constrain the agency of the other (I use Tsing’s application of the term here, which she contrasts with how it is used by <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ongGlobalAssemblages2007"><strong>ongGlobalAssemblages2007?</strong></a>)</span>). What are the intersecting land use practices and ecologies that have shaped wildfire risk in the Poudre Canyon? How do people understand landscapes as hazardous as a result of these relations and following their experiences of the Cameron Peak Fire?</p>
<p>Third, because anthropology has primarily approached understanding conditions of risk by examining socially produced patterns of vulnerability <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oliver-smithAnthropologicalResearchHazards1996"><strong>oliver-smithAnthropologicalResearchHazards1996?</strong></a>)</span> and resilience, I address my use of those terms here and explain how they intersect with disaster scholarship emphasizing the importance of engaging local perspectives through ethnographic methods. Vulnerability has been a unifying concept across disciplinary engagements with disaster and has served as a useful theoretical approach to understanding unequal distribution of risk. Anthropologists have also problematized “vulnerability thinking” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-marinoVulnerabilityOutdatedConcept2020"><strong>marinoVulnerabilityOutdatedConcept2020?</strong></a> 33)</span> in the context of disaster <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosResilienceCommentaryVantage2016">Barrios 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-barriosUnwieldyDisastersEngaging2019"><strong>barriosUnwieldyDisastersEngaging2019?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-ojhaPolicyPoliticsTechnocratic2016"><strong>ojhaPolicyPoliticsTechnocratic2016?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-sunSocialProductionDisasters2018"><strong>sunSocialProductionDisasters2018?</strong></a>)</span>, such as by identifying the ascription of certain groups as vulnerable as an “act of marginalization” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-marinoVulnerabilityOutdatedConcept2020"><strong>marinoVulnerabilityOutdatedConcept2020?</strong></a> 44)</span> that can become a “pretext for intervention” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sunSocialProductionDisasters2018"><strong>sunSocialProductionDisasters2018?</strong></a> 629)</span>. Recognizing this tension, I follow Marino and Faas in conceptualizing vulnerability as “assemblages of diverse subjects, institutions, materials, and meanings that are vulnerable to acts of oppression, suppression, theft, and erasure” (2020: 34), rather than categorizing people or communities as such.</p>
<p>In the context of this research project, I am interested in the ways individuals inhabiting particular landscapes like the Poudre Canyon become exposed to and experience vulnerability through bureaucratic processes like fire prevention and disaster recovery programs, not to mention technocratic regimes governing insurance claims and rebuilding efforts. Roberto Barrios characterizes this as “disaster neoliberalism” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosGoverningAffectNeoliberalism2017">Barrios 2017</a>: 9)</span> to describe how post-disaster contexts are mobilized by political actors to steer recovery work in particular ways undergirded by neoliberal and market driven technical solutions rather than in response to the “socio-material conditions” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosGoverningAffectNeoliberalism2017">Barrios 2017</a>: 256)</span> of those affected <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-adamsMarketsSorrowLabors2013">Adams 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-kleinShockDoctrineRise2008">Klein 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-collierNeoliberalismNaturalDisaster2014"><strong>collierNeoliberalismNaturalDisaster2014?</strong></a>)</span>. This can also be the case in climate change adaptation contexts, where “projects which seek to empower actors to manage their resources, produce realignments of power and knowledge that then shape who is invested in what manner in those projects” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nightingalePowerPoliticsClimate2017">Nightingale 2017</a>)</span>. Similarly, in risk management, the neoliberal paradigm of resilience institutionalizes individual responsibility for risk even while being monitored through governmental oversight <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-josephResilienceEmbeddedNeoliberalism2013"><strong>josephResilienceEmbeddedNeoliberalism2013?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>One example of this in the context of the Poudre Canyon is the interagency (e.g. nonprofit, county, state, and federal Forest Service) focus on personal responsibility for creating a safe zone around one’s home to protect it from fire accompanied by judgement of those who <em>choose</em> to live in fire-prone areas. Absent from discussions about the presence of people in hazardous landscapes is any acknowledgement that residence patterns are a result of federal colonial legacies which encouraged settlement on lands from which Nunt’zi (Ute), Hinono’eino’ (Arapaho), and Tsistsistas (Cheyenne), and other Indigenous peoples had been recently expelled. To facilitate colonial settlement across the western U.S., The Homestead Act of 1862 provided quarter-section allotments (160 acres) to settlers who resided on the land continuously for five years <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-drexlerResearchGuidesHomestead2020"><strong>drexlerResearchGuidesHomestead2020?</strong></a>)</span>. The discovery of gold in Colorado and its use to help fund the Civil War also facilitated settler expansion and contributed to treaties being broken by Colorado territorial governments with Tribes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-daleyLongDenverWas2023">Daley 2023</a>)</span>. This series of injustices along with the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 of 230 Hinono’eino’ (Arapaho) and Tsistsistas (Cheyenne) led to the expulsion of most Indigenous peoples and Tribes from Colorado. This history is both echoed throughout the United States and unique to Colorado. New Mexico, Colorado’s southern neighbor, for example, today has twenty-three sovereign Indigenous nations across nineteen pueblos and three reservations <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NewMexicosUnique2024"><strong>NewMexicosUnique2024?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Wildfire risk reduction efforts emphasizing individual responsibility also ignore federal forest management practices which excluded fire from landscapes as a matter of policy for 100 years <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vanwagtendonkHistoryEvolutionWildland2007">van Wagtendonk 2007</a>)</span>, both in the form of fire suppression and through the removal of Indigenous peoples and any cultural burning practices in which they may have engaged <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bakerIndiansFireRocky2002"><strong>bakerIndiansFireRocky2002?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-huckabyTreesTellTale"><strong>huckabyTreesTellTale?</strong></a>)</span>. State or county-led initiatives to encourage homeowners to submit to voluntary assessments of wildfire risk around their houses are typically conducted through local fire districts, as is the case in the Poudre. As a volunteer with the Poudre Canyon Fire Protection District (PCFPD), I am a “neighborhood ambassador,” conducting assessments at homeowners’ requests with other members and submitting a report available to homeowners and stored in a software system at the county. Along with four other fire districts or departments, the PCFPD received federal monies from the second round of the Community Wildfire Defense Grants program, funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. A local nonprofit, the Coalition for the Poudre River Watershed (CPRW), and the Larimer County Office of Emergency Management applied for and will manage the grant on behalf of the four communities. In order to be eligible for this grant, the PCFPD had to complete an updated Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP), and only those homeowners who volunteered to have their homes assessed will be eligible for funding to help with wildfire mitigation tasks identified in the homeowner report. These various connected initiatives are all part of state-sponsored efforts to encourage a bottom-up approach to wildfire risk reduction at the individual and community level.</p>
<p>My analysis shows how wildfire preparedness constitutes a relationship between the state and its citizens, couched in the language of resilience, risk reduction, and individual responsibility. I contribute to the extensive scholarship identifying similar dynamics in the Global South and provide a novel illustration from the Global North, where this particular kind of relationship is analyzed much less frequently. To provide an example from the Global South, Nepal is a country where the population has been deemed vulnerable to hazards in various iterations over many decades and sometimes blamed for their own vulnerability. In the 1970s, for example, the Theory of Environmental Degradation (THED), studied and discursively repeated by many scholars and the impetus for numerous international aid projects, posited that rapid population growth was leading to catastrophic environmental degradation. The formulation of interventions to counter the crisis was based on the production of scientific knowledge proving the case, which ignored inconvenient political histories of deforestation by the state in Nepal <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-guthmanRepresentingCrisisTheory1997">Guthman 1997</a>)</span>. This is similar to how assessments of wildfire risk in Colorado at the individual homeowner level obscure colonial settlement policies responsible for contemporary patterns of residence in rural areas and ignore federal policies of fire suppression and timber harvesting contributing to the “wildfire crisis” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-forestserviceConfrontingWildfireCrisis2022">Service 2022</a>)</span> today.</p>
<p>Counter reactions to the idea of blaming ecological collapse on local populations in Nepal produced interventions which encouraged what Guthman refers to as a neopopulist agenda to promote forestry initiatives at the community level <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-guthmanRepresentingCrisisTheory1997">Guthman 1997</a>)</span>, similar to the kind of wildfire risk reduction initiatives I describe in Chapter 3. In Nepal, interventions designed to counter vulnerability to climate change discursively reproduce assessments of risk based on technocratic definitions, rather than on local contexts and voices <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ojhaPolicyPoliticsTechnocratic2016"><strong>ojhaPolicyPoliticsTechnocratic2016?</strong></a>)</span>. Similarly, in writing about climate change adaptation efforts promoting cooperative arrangements at the local level in Nepal, Nightingale highlights how adaptation initiatives are inherently political processes playing a role “not only shaping adaptation outcomes, but also how they are embedded within the institutions proposed, the measures adopted, and who is considered to require adaptation support or capable of guiding and managing environmental change” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nightingalePowerPoliticsClimate2017">Nightingale 2017</a>: 12)</span>. Efforts in Colorado to reduce wildfire risk exposure to communities through individual action in the area around the home referred to as “The Home Ignition Zone” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coloradostateforestserviceHomeIgnitionZone2021"><strong>coloradostateforestserviceHomeIgnitionZone2021?</strong></a>)</span> reflect similar kinds of statist prescriptions to address vulnerability and restrictions on eligibility to resources based on voluntary participation in such prescriptions. I further discuss governmental practices of wildfire resilience in the context of the Poudre Canyon in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>Fourth, resilience is a term adapted from ecology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hollingResilienceStabilityEcological2013"><strong>hollingResilienceStabilityEcological2013?</strong></a>)</span>, broadly referring to the capacity of social-ecological systems to bounce back from disturbances wrought by disasters <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oliver-smithTheorizingVulnerabilityGlobalized2004"><strong>oliver-smithTheorizingVulnerabilityGlobalized2004?</strong></a>)</span> or climate change. The criticisms of resilience approaches are too many to address here (for a comprehensive discussion, see Barrios 2016) but to generalize, defining what adaptation or recovery means in post-disaster and climate change contexts is fraught with bureaucratic complications and discursive power relations <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosResilienceCommentaryVantage2016">Barrios 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-nightingalePowerPoliticsClimate2017">Nightingale 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-ojhaPolicyPoliticsTechnocratic2016"><strong>ojhaPolicyPoliticsTechnocratic2016?</strong></a>)</span>. A critical resilience approach, one which also accepts the widespread use of the word in disaster contexts, centers the desires and voices of the people and communities affected <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosResilienceCommentaryVantage2016">Barrios 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-hoffmanCultureCrucialFactor2015">Hoffman 2015</a>)</span> and attends to resilience as a set of narratives, experiences, and meanings <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020"><strong>schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020?</strong></a>)</span>. This dissertation foregrounds the voices of those who are living with the impacts of the Cameron Peak Fire as a way to “provide informative critical insights into the bureaucratic, technocratic, and institutional practices”<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosResilienceCommentaryVantage2016">Barrios 2016</a>: 36)</span> affecting their capacity to recover and plan their futures.</p>
<p>While taking up wildfires as a specific subject of analysis, my research is grounded in the rich anthropological scholarship on disasters by examining how wildfires are socially and materially co-constituted, in what ways recovery efforts are embedded within institutional processes, and through using ethnography to understand local narratives and experiences of landscape changes.</p>

<p>The record-breaking behavior of wildfires across the West signify a kind of “runaway change” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-petrynaWildfiresEdgesScience2018"><strong>petrynaWildfiresEdgesScience2018?</strong></a>)</span> defying historical patterns and attributed to climate change-related factors like drought <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-williamsGrowingImpactWildfire2022"><strong>williamsGrowingImpactWildfire2022?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-higueraRecordsettingClimateEnabled2021"><strong>higueraRecordsettingClimateEnabled2021?</strong></a>)</span>. The Anthropocene is an unofficial yet nonetheless widely used term to refer to a new geological epoch characterized by unprecedented human impacts on Earth’s ecosystems expressed in changes to the climate like more persistent droughts, sea level rise, and melting glaciers. Human activity has fueled significant changes to our climatic system, and there are a number of papers linking extreme wildfire behavior with these changes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rileyMid21stcenturyClimateChanges2016"><strong>rileyMid21stcenturyClimateChanges2016?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-gossClimateChangeIncreasing2020"><strong>gossClimateChangeIncreasing2020?</strong></a>)</span>, although climate is only one driver among many, including the amount and type of vegetation and the impacts of human land use <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rileyWillLandscapeFire2019"><strong>rileyWillLandscapeFire2019?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There is criticism of the extensive use of the term Anthropocene across disciplines to describe extreme wildfires in particular and unprecedented changes to our climate more broadly which manifest in other forms of devastation. Anthropologists are among those who problematize the term, for embracing a “colonial temporality” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jobsonCaseLettingAnthropology2020"><strong>jobsonCaseLettingAnthropology2020?</strong></a> 261)</span> that attempts to map “European historical experiences, frameworks, and chronologies onto the rest of the world” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-morrisonProvincializingAnthropoceneEurocentrism2018"><strong>morrisonProvincializingAnthropoceneEurocentrism2018?</strong></a> 3)</span>.

<p>A subset of the Anthropocene germane to the subject of this paper is what the historian Stephen Pyne refers to as the Pyrocene, delineating “a planetary fire age”<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pyneWelcomePyrocene2021"><strong>pyneWelcomePyrocene2021?</strong></a>)</span> created by humans. He attributes the Pyrocene to the deliberate exclusion of fire on the landscape while at the same time “taking fuel out of the geologic past, burning it in the present…, and then releasing the effluent into the geologic future” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pyneWelcomePyrocene2021"><strong>pyneWelcomePyrocene2021?</strong></a>)</span>, referring, of course, to the burning of fossil fuels. The Pyrocene may be a part of as Late Industrialism <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fortunEthnograhyLateIndustrialism2012"><strong>fortunEthnograhyLateIndustrialism2012?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-ahmannBreathingLateIndustrialism2020"><strong>ahmannBreathingLateIndustrialism2020?</strong></a>)</span>, characterized as “the limits of available critical constructs for explaining issues of particular concern within environmental politics” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fortunLatourLateIndustrialism2014"><strong>fortunLatourLateIndustrialism2014?</strong></a>)</span>. Recognition of this new age of fire is reflected in other scholars’ work to define more severe wildfire, to distinguish between wildfire, which has always been a part of western U.S. landscapes, and more destructive wildfire, articulated through terms such as extreme wildfire <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tedimDefiningExtremeWildfire2018"><strong>tedimDefiningExtremeWildfire2018?</strong></a>)</span>, megafire <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-busbyInventoryAnalysisFire2023"><strong>busbyInventoryAnalysisFire2023?</strong></a>)</span>, and conflagration <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-macleanYoungMenFire1992"><strong>macleanYoungMenFire1992?</strong></a>)</span>. I adopt Maclean’s term conflagration to describe the CPF and to characterize a wildfire with extreme fire behavior which is also devastating for people’s lives, which I explain in more detail in Chapter 4.</p>
<p>The rapid transformation of the physical, cultural, and ecological landscape of the Cache la Poudre River corridor over the course of the nineteenth century as a direct result of settler colonial development and the displacement of the region’s Indigenous inhabitants illustrates a geographically relevant previous period of significant change which must be considered in direct relation to contemporary shifts in social and ecological systems. Recognizing the reality that some of Colorado’s wildfires are behaving in unprecedented ways, in terms of frequency, size, intensity, level of destruction, and duration, my research engages directly with how citizens, scientists, and practitioners grapple with the capacity, or lack thereof, of our social and political institutions to adequately respond to rapid developments, new seasonal realities, and novel geographic possibilities of occurrence. I address the specific ways these three groups are making sense of large-scale change wrought by wildfire and post-fire flooding in Chapter 4.</p>

<p>A special series of Fieldsights, omprising almost twenty anthropological contributions from across five continents published by the Society for Cultural Anthropology, examines the relations between forests and humans in the context of larger and more intense wildfires. With a few exceptions, many of the contributors do not usually study wildfire, and this series underscores its growing relevance to the discipline of anthropology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gilbertFirestormCriticalApproaches2021"><strong>gilbertFirestormCriticalApproaches2021?</strong></a>)</span> and specifically to sociocultural anthropologists. This may be because, as Ryan Cecil Jobson describes, the artificial separation between the climate crisis as manifested in the form of catastrophic wildfires and the political and intellectual project of anthropology is collapsing (Jobson 2020). Jobson asks us to imagine a future for the discipline that, not unlike the persistent focus of disaster anthropology, attends to the “local, intimate, and affective dimensions of climate change” (263), understands landscapes as entangled within human and other than human relations, and resists easy technological fixes.</p>
<p>Contextualized within the larger frame of dissonance associated with geoengineered solutions to future climate conditions, the “spectacle of technological promise” (Petryna 2018) normalizes wildland firefighting that aims to combat ever more extreme fire behavior. Petryna uses the term “horizoning work” to describe research that attempts to make knowable an unknown future, in this case in the context of “runaway” climate change (Petryna 2018). In this, she recognizes the selective adherence to particular time horizons by certain groups of people with differentiated access to power, where, for example, municipalities might understand disaster as a short-term event rather than an enduring social and economic challenge. My research builds on Petryna’s idea of time horizons to interrogate the entangled temporalities of “technocratic time” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gagneWaitingFloodTechnocratic2019"><strong>gagneWaitingFloodTechnocratic2019?</strong></a>)</span> and locally grounded <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-braceHumanGeographiesClimate2010"><strong>braceHumanGeographiesClimate2010?</strong></a>)</span> experiences during and after the wildfire. I use Martindale’s concept of entanglement to capture the complexity and variability of the interactions of different temporalities and to understand agency as existing at multiple scales <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-martindaleEntanglementTinkeringStructural2009">Martindale 2009</a>)</span>. How do people experience periods of evacuation from their homes? How do these change after the fire and in response to newly exposed hazards, such as debris flows? Beyond a human-centered sense of time, my research examines the time horizons associated with various ecological, geomorphic, and climatic processes which are influenced by anthropogenic forces and which intersect with human lives. I explore these themes in the context of how people experienced the CPF in the Poudre Canyon in Chapter 2.</p>
<p>The physical processes of fire itself are the object of analysis in a paper by two anthropologists and a geographer who mobilize fire as a form of “elemental thinking” about the Anthropocene to uncover “the specific agents and histories” of wildfire across different scales within specific spatial and temporal frames <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nealeEternalFlameElemental2019"><strong>nealeEternalFlameElemental2019?</strong></a> 126)</span>. “Thinking with wildfire,” they argue, helps us to understand fire as “a point of exchange conditioned by its specific time and space” (126). My research draws on their conceptualization of the conjunctural existence of fire as a way of understanding the multiple agentive and material human and non-human formations which condition wildfires, affect their behavior, and shape the trajectory of their social, political, and ecological impacts on people, governance, and environments.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Temporality, Materiality, and Landscapes</h3>
<p>Wildfires are the result of a convergence of different scalar and temporal ecological (Pausas and Keeley 2009), meteorological, climatic (Higuera and Abatzoglou 2021) and anthropomorphic processes, interacting with terrain (Neale, Zahara, and Smith 2019) that condition the possibility of their existence and shape the nature of their outcomes. Understanding how wildfires occur, and the trajectories they take, requires reaching back beyond the start of the wildfire itself and also into the future to examine the overlapping timescales of the human and other than human material processes which co-create them and shape their ongoing social and material consequences <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kosekUnderstoriesPoliticalLife2006">Kosek 2006</a>)</span>. On account of climate change, these timescales are rapidly shifting and conditioning different potentials for wildfires to occur and also impacting how they unfold <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gossClimateChangeIncreasing2020"><strong>gossClimateChangeIncreasing2020?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-diffenbaughVerificationExtremeEvent2020"><strong>diffenbaughVerificationExtremeEvent2020?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-borundaScienceConnectingWildfires2020"><strong>borundaScienceConnectingWildfires2020?</strong></a>)</span>. The anthropologically relevant conceptualizations of landscape, temporality, and materiality emerge out of the biophysical processes and governance practices of wildfire. I engage literature from anthropology, geography, and Indigenous epistemologies to explore these concepts below.</p>
<p>The segmentation of time is a cultural, political, linguistic, and symbolic process <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-munnCulturalAnthropologyTime1992"><strong>munnCulturalAnthropologyTime1992?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-morrisonPuttingTimeIts2016"><strong>morrisonPuttingTimeIts2016?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-natcherNotionsTimeSentience2007"><strong>natcherNotionsTimeSentience2007?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-turinTemporalConceptsFormulations2020"><strong>turinTemporalConceptsFormulations2020?</strong></a>)</span>. Conceptualizations of time shape narrative frameworks for understanding and responding to both disasters and climate change. The official bookends of disaster events, particularly wildfires, contrast with the “slow-onset” and global scale of climate change, and underscore how an understanding of disasters as “temporary aberrations from normal conditions” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fiskeSlowOnsetDisasterClimate2019"><strong>fiskeSlowOnsetDisasterClimate2019?</strong></a> 139)</span> influences disaster response in the United States. Anthropological understandings of time can reveal how the temporalities of different kinds of disasters overlap with the “seasonal and everyday rhythms of communities and households,” how disasters are conceptualized, and how disasters shape societies over time <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sorensenSocialLifeDisasters2015"><strong>sorensenSocialLifeDisasters2015?</strong></a> 74)</span>. During and after disasters, different stakeholders and administrators conceptualize and operationalize time in sometimes discordant ways <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-murphyNavigatingTemporalitiesPlace2021"><strong>murphyNavigatingTemporalitiesPlace2021?</strong></a>)</span> that can constrain the capacity of those impacted to fully recover from loss or prepare for impending hazards <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gagneWaitingFloodTechnocratic2019"><strong>gagneWaitingFloodTechnocratic2019?</strong></a>)</span>. Disaster recovery is often plagued by the bureaucratization and conditionality of various relief efforts, such as in accessing financial or social services or obtaining permission to rebuild <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-adamsMarketsSorrowLabors2013">Adams 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-shneidermanExpertiseLabourMobility2021"><strong>shneidermanExpertiseLabourMobility2021?</strong></a>)</span>. Procedures governing these efforts operate under their own temporality, a “regime of technocratic time” (Gagné 2019).</p>
<p>This institutionalization of time is linked to settler colonial governance practices <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-awasisAnishinaabeTimeTemporalities2020"><strong>awasisAnishinaabeTimeTemporalities2020?</strong></a>)</span> that universalize definitions of beginnings and endings that may disenfranchise those affected by disaster. One example of this kind of potential disenfranchisement as it relates to the CPF was a decision by the county to remove a damaged private bridge because of its potential threat to life and property downstream. Material from a massive debris flow upstream in the first summer after the CPF had kicked up the central bridge abutment. One resident had it assessed by an engineer who thought it could be repaired at the same time that she located steel girders and arranged to have them transported in order to replace the existing girders. The opportunity to repair the bridge was denied by the county in part because of the amount of time it would take to go through county and federal bridge permitting processes. Although the bridge was damaged in a disaster, the county was not willing to expedite their administrative oversight in order to allow residents to keep their bridge. One county official told me that a new bridge now costs between $1.2 and $1.8 million. Most private bridges in the Poudre were built by individuals and families prior to county and federal permitting and engineering requirements for the cost of materials decades ago. The repair and replacement of private bridges will be a significant financial and bureaucratic challenge for an increasing number of homeowners as a result. As of the fall of 2024, the homeowners still do not have a bridge, effectively preventing the majority of residents from accessing their homes for over three years. In this way, time can function as a tool of power and governance <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-awasisAnishinaabeTimeTemporalities2020"><strong>awasisAnishinaabeTimeTemporalities2020?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-ahmannItsExhaustingCreate2018"><strong>ahmannItsExhaustingCreate2018?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-munnCulturalAnthropologyTime1992"><strong>munnCulturalAnthropologyTime1992?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-nixonSlowViolenceEnvironmentalism2011"><strong>nixonSlowViolenceEnvironmentalism2011?</strong></a>)</span>. This is referred to as “chronocracy”, or the ways in which “temporal regimes” are used to produce unequal relations between humans “or between humans and other organisms and our ecologies” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kirtsoglouIntroduction2020"><strong>kirtsoglouIntroduction2020?</strong></a> 3)</span>. Or put another way, “between those who control time and those who are subject to time” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-widgerMonsoonUncertaintiesHydrochemical2020"><strong>widgerMonsoonUncertaintiesHydrochemical2020?</strong></a> 127)</span>.</p>
<p>The material temporalities of ecological systems themselves also shape “chronocratic” (Kirtsoglou and Simpson 2020: 6) responses, whether, for example, in response to fast-moving entities like wildfires or slow-moving changes to climatic systems. In Gansu, China, the temporality of state processes is reflected in “the chronopolitical stakes of environmental governance” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zeeHoldingPatternsSand2017">Zee 2017</a>: 218)</span> in the context of encroaching sand that threatens to envelope the inhabited spaces around it. In this example, “sand as a material, narrative, and processual substrate of emergent temporal formations” (218) both opens up possibilities of and circumscribes political intervention <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barbosaResistingDisasterChronopolitics2021"><strong>barbosaResistingDisasterChronopolitics2021?</strong></a>)</span>. Barbosa and Coates theorize chronopolitics specifically in the context of disasters, as a “disruptive time-space” (2021: 10) in which the state produces narratives of risk following a disaster that allow it to fulfill agendas which would be less politically palatable under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Anthropological, geographic, and Indigenous epistemological approaches which counter chronocracy link understandings of time with attention to the material landscape (Awasis 2020: 832), subvert the idea of a single, human-centered temporal frame (Widger and Wickramasinghe 2020; Whyte 2018), and attend to local experiences of time (Brace and Geoghegan 2010; Murphy and Williams 2021). Based on interviews with Anishinaabe community members, for example, the geographer Sakihitowin Awasis categorizes Anishinaabe temporalities into: periodicities (i.e. seasons, election cycles); timeframes (i.e. seven generations before/after the present); kinship relations (i.e. land-based sociopolitical systems vs. “hetero-nuclear” family ties); and other than human temporalities (i.e. migration or hibernation cycles) (2020: 833). The concept of “materialist time” (Widger and Wickramasinghe 2020: 124) considers the role of climate and other elements enacting “a ‘gravitational pull’ on relations in the world” (2020: 137) that illuminate “human encounter[s] with geo-climatic processes” (2020: 139). This is particularly relevant in thinking about the ways wildfires are shaped by the material and temporal formations of the “weather-world” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ingoldFootprintsWeatherworldWalking2010">Ingold 2010</a>: S135)</span>, climate, and terrain <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gordilloGravityPrimacyTerrain2020"><strong>gordilloGravityPrimacyTerrain2020?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In literature on sense of place and attachment to place, a number of scholars <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-berroetaPlaceSubjectivityContinuum2021"><strong>berroetaPlaceSubjectivityContinuum2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-crateSakhaAlaasPlace2021"><strong>crateSakhaAlaasPlace2021?</strong></a>)</span> note how environmental changes or “shock events” (Schlosberg, Della Bosca, and Craven 2020: 239) such as disasters create a “temporal rupture, manifesting as dissonance between past experiences, present realities and future ideas of sociality and sense of self in place” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-asklandLivedExperiencesEnvironmental2018">Askland and Bunn 2018</a>: 18)</span>. This dissonance is also referred to as solastalgia <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-albrechtSolastalgiaDistressCaused2007"><strong>albrechtSolastalgiaDistressCaused2007?</strong></a>)</span>. One way of bridging this rupture is through a temporal orientation toward the future, connecting past processes of landscape change to the anticipation of future climates and environments that are at once unknowable, dynamic, and full of possibility <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-desilveyMakingSenseTransience2012"><strong>desilveyMakingSenseTransience2012?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-whitingtonFingerprintBellwetherModel2013"><strong>whitingtonFingerprintBellwetherModel2013?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-whyteIndigenousScienceFiction2018"><strong>whyteIndigenousScienceFiction2018?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-heatheringtonHavensBlight2021"><strong>heatheringtonHavensBlight2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-petrynaWildfiresEdgesScience2018"><strong>petrynaWildfiresEdgesScience2018?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-baldwinSurvivingSixthExtinction2018"><strong>baldwinSurvivingSixthExtinction2018?</strong></a>)</span>. In Chapter 4, I explore the specific ways people living and working in and conducting research in the Poudre underwent a process of recalibration in response to the dramatic landscape changes resulting from the CPF.</p>
<p>The links between the temporal frames of the past, present, and future become legible through theorizing landscape, which is the basis of analysis for this research project and what connects the various literature on disaster, governance, temporality, and materiality. My own observations after the CPF led to a kind of embodied understanding of landscapes as processual and as connected to multiscalar and temporal material formations. In the Methodological Framework section and in Chapter 4, I further discuss literature in anthropology and geography to describe how I engage with landscape as a foundation for ethnographic inquiry.</p>
<p>In this dissertation, I build on previous scholarship to explore how temporality is mobilized, experienced, and understood in disaster response, both by those impacted by disaster and by institutional actors coordinating planning and recovery efforts. In Chapter 2, for example, I show how cascading consequences resulting from the CPF persist long after the wildfire was declared contained. My research connects with literature emphasizing the importance of landscape-level experiences of temporality in relation to the material formations of weather, terrain, climate, and disaster. I ask how an anthropological engagement with the processual and relational qualities of the material world might help illuminate the ways in which various phenomena and beings interact to co-constitute the conditions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ingoldBeingAliveEssays2011">Ingold 2011</a>)</span> for wildfires to occur and converge in “moments in which incommensurable frames occupy the same event” (Tsing 2019: 226).</p>

There are five primary reasons why this research matters. First, every wildfire is at once attributable to more or less the same factors (i.e. weather, terrain, fuel, climate, and human (in)action) and at the same time constituted by unique, situated social, political, and ecological landscape processes occurring at multiple spatiotemporal scales. Understanding the circumstances through which the CPF came to be illuminates how specific landscapes are co-created by human and other human processes which also have a bearing on how the consequences of this fire will continue to unfold. Second, documenting how people in the Poudre Canyon engage with shifting landscapes as a result of the wildfire and understand the “dynamic nature of the past” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barnettScienceLoss2016"><strong>barnettScienceLoss2016?</strong></a> 978)</span> contributes to an appreciation of future landscapes as always in process and subject to change (DeSilvey 2012). This research contributes to an awareness of landscapes as “time materializing” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-benderTimeLandscape2002"><strong>benderTimeLandscape2002?</strong></a> S103)</span>, opening up a pathway for people, communities, and governments reckoning with loss as a result of disaster or climate change to envision and plan for possible futures.</p>
<p>Wildfire and its cascading social-ecological impacts <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ruskMultihazardSusceptibilityExposure2021"><strong>ruskMultihazardSusceptibilityExposure2021?</strong></a>)</span> are understudied within the anthropology of disaster, relative to, for example, hurricanes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-adamsMarketsSorrowLabors2013">Adams 2013</a>; <a href="#ref-dyerTellThemWe2019"><strong>dyerTellThemWe2019?</strong></a>)</span>, tsumanis <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hastrupMaterializationsDisasterRecovering2010"><strong>hastrupMaterializationsDisasterRecovering2010?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-slaterPublicAnthropologyDisaster2014"><strong>slaterPublicAnthropologyDisaster2014?</strong></a>)</span>, and earthquakes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kulstad-gonzalezTransborderDisastersVulnerability2019"><strong>kulstad-gonzalezTransborderDisastersVulnerability2019?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-shneidermanHouseHouseholdHome2023"><strong>shneidermanHouseHouseholdHome2023?</strong></a>)</span>. In a book edited by two prominent disaster anthropologists originally published in 1999, out of nineteen chapters, only two are about one wildfire, the Oakland “firestorm” in 1991 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oliver-smithAngryEarthDisaster2019"><strong>oliver-smithAngryEarthDisaster2019?</strong></a>)</span>. This may be because, contemporaneously, wildfire has only emerged as a disaster across multiple states and countries all at once over roughly the last twenty-five years. In the U.S., over the course of a century up until the 1970s, wildfire was actively suppressed as a matter of policy <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vanwagtendonkHistoryEvolutionWildland2007">van Wagtendonk 2007</a>)</span> and under the influence of the timber industry <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hudsonFireManagementAmerican2011"><strong>hudsonFireManagementAmerican2011?</strong></a>)</span>. Functionally, even while fire exclusion is no longer official policy, fire suppression is still largely practiced. There are multiple reasons for this, including continued political pressure to put out fires. For a broader discussion, see <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schultzForestServiceFire2019"><strong>schultzForestServiceFire2019?</strong></a>)</span>. In Colorado extensive logging along the Front Range affected forests’ relationship with fire over time, also contributing to more catastrophic fires <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-merrillr.kaufmannGoodFireBad2020"><strong>merrillr.kaufmannGoodFireBad2020?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>As a number of interview participants conveyed to me, fairly successful fire suppression for 100 years gave us the illusion that we could control fire indefinitely. Thus, how it has historically been governed has material consequences for how it behaves today. Similar to hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis, wildfire is an agent of ecological change, at least in ecosystems which evolved with fire. It is, however, the only naturally occurring hazard I am aware of that we actively try to fight with a federal (firefighting) force. Ironically, the scientific consensus is that one of the best, and perhaps only ways, to prevent more extreme wildfires, is to increase the frequency and acreage of prescribed fire <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-stoddardEcologicalRestorationGuided2021"><strong>stoddardEcologicalRestorationGuided2021?</strong></a>)</span>. Some forest ecologists caution that prescribed fire may not work well across all tree species, which have a wide range of fire regimes at different elevations. Prescribed fire for hazard reduction may not always coincide with ecological restoration goals for the same reason <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kaufmannHistoricalFireRegimes2018"><strong>kaufmannHistoricalFireRegimes2018?</strong></a>)</span>. The rationale is both that prescribed fire can imitate low severity fire, what is sometimes called “good fire” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-saraha.clarkGoodFire2021"><strong>saraha.clarkGoodFire2021?</strong></a>)</span>, and that prescribed burn areas have the potential to slow down extreme wildfire <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-davisTammReviewMetaanalysis2024"><strong>davisTammReviewMetaanalysis2024?</strong></a>)</span>. As one participant who works for the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) put it to me, “…We know that the fuels will get dry and will get dry again. …We know we will have high wind events. …We know there will be ignition. So, the only thing we can control is the fuels. And the only way we can control the fuels is by burning them. And it’s either going to burn under worse conditions or better conditions.” All of this makes wildfire a rich object of anthropological analysis.</p>
<p>Third, the study of wildfire is currently dominated by scientific discourses, and although there is growing interdisciplinary scholarship, research on wildfire is limited within the wider discipline of anthropology. Because of its increased frequency and severity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-robbinsPrairiesFireMontana2021"><strong>robbinsPrairiesFireMontana2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-schoennagelAdaptMoreWildfire2017"><strong>schoennagelAdaptMoreWildfire2017?</strong></a>)</span>, wildfire is also an increasingly relevant phenomenon not only for Coloradoans but for more and more people across the American West and in countries like Canada <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-burstonTheresNothingLeft2021"><strong>burstonTheresNothingLeft2021?</strong></a>)</span> and Australia <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nealeKnowingWildfireRisk2016"><strong>nealeKnowingWildfireRisk2016?</strong></a>)</span>. My research draws from the extensive scholarship of the anthropology of disasters and contributes in novel ways based on wildfire’s unique position as it pertains to fire ecology, landscape histories, and institutional response. My research challenges conventional narratives of communities who live in fire-adapted landscapes and the programs designed to reduce wildfire risk in these areas, adding to global critical scholarship on vulnerability and resilience in adaptation and risk management frameworks. I also identify the jurisdictional challenges for rural, unincorporated communities in navigating wildfire preparedness and recovery, adding to limited scholarship on how incorporation, or lack thereof, shapes environmental risk <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rumbachSixDisasterClimate2023"><strong>rumbachSixDisasterClimate2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-rumbachUrbanDisastersCity2019"><strong>rumbachUrbanDisastersCity2019?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Fourth, this project provides timely and relevant contributions to anthropologies of climate change as they intersect with disaster and with wildfire in particular. Climate change discourses are dominated by expert, scientific knowledges at global scales (Brace and Geoghegan 2010), and my research highlights valuable local knowledges about local, landscape-level changes in dialog with these discourses. The social sciences have a critical role to play in delineating approaches that underscore resilience as a set of narratives, experiences, and meanings rather than solely within the context of the economic and infrastructural costs of destruction (Schlosberg, Della Bosca, and Craven 2020). My research considers how conflagrations are disruptions of lived experiences and relational networks, how affective belonging is reconstituted in the aftermath of disasters <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020"><strong>schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-asklandLivedExperiencesEnvironmental2018">Askland and Bunn 2018</a>)</span>, and attends to individual and collective capacities for grappling with uncertainty <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-grovesBombMyBackyard2015"><strong>grovesBombMyBackyard2015?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-petrynaWhatHorizonNavigating2015"><strong>petrynaWhatHorizonNavigating2015?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-sword-danielsEmbodiedUncertaintyLiving2018"><strong>sword-danielsEmbodiedUncertaintyLiving2018?</strong></a>)</span> through sensemaking processes. My research demonstrates that an understanding of nature as agentive combined with an acceptance of lack of control regarding wildfire may enable people to cope with the affective dimensions of drastic environmental changes.</p>
<p>The ongoing potential for other disasters and persistent vulnerability as a result of the wildfire in the Poudre Canyon is complex and multifaceted. The community’s recent experience of disaster and its continued aftermath present an opportunity to mobilize awareness of and interest in risk to explore how people understand the contours of landscape hazards as a result of their experiences. Federal, county, and municipal agencies, along with non-profits, researchers, and community and religious organizations, had or continue to have a large presence in the canyon, undertaking forest and stream restoration, cleaning up debris, and identifying hazards introduced by the wildfire. My research is a time-sensitive project to observe, participate in, and interview representatives of coordinated and volunteer recovery efforts while they were under way, offering a unique opportunity to view and record disaster response in real time and ascertain how people perceive and experience different aspects of recovery.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a gap in ethnographic, anthropological research situated in Colorado. As much as we may generalize about the history and present circumstances of wildfire across the American West, Colorado has a particular historical trajectory. Its social and environmental histories combined with land tenure practices influence how wildfire is governed in the state <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pyneInteriorWestFire2018"><strong>pyneInteriorWestFire2018?</strong></a>)</span>. In the Poudre Canyon, the story of wildfire is partially told through the history of Indigenous inhabitance and colonial settlement, land ownership, and the fire regimes of different tree species. This project gives voice to the important ways that anthropology can contribute to knowing the stories of specific places and contextualizing them within broader social and political narratives. My research provides localized context to understand the experiences of one community, and those who intersect with it, in relation to the state’s largest wildfire at a time when understanding the social, ecological, and political trajectories of each wildfire in relation to how it impacts communities is increasingly relevant.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Methodological Framework</h2>
<p>I conducted ethnographic research for this dissertation over the course of more than two years (2022-2024) residing in the upper Poudre Canyon, where I continue to live. My own life history in this place originates with my baptism as an infant at my extended family’s historic home, preceded by four generations of inhabitance before me and one after. Though I had only lived in the Poudre full time on two previous, brief occasions, my family’s tenure here over nearly 130 years and the intimate connection I felt with the landscape and our house, made this place home more than any other. It was also what contributed to the sense that this research is situated in my own backyard. My research methods took several different forms, including participant observation, semi-structured, walking, and go-along interviews, and a methodological engagement with landscape. I explain all of these in the sections below, first discussing how the landscape of the Poudre, and sometimes my family’s land, was a kind of living laboratory for my research and also the basis for engagement with some of the people I interviewed across all three groups. The groups comprised community members, fire and emergency practitioners, and scientists, with overlap across these roles among some individuals. Because I provide an overview of my methods in each of Chapters 2, 3, and 4, along with information about the study area, in this section I will focus on providing ethnographic context of the Poudre Canyon community and interview methods with practitioners and scientists.</p>
<div id="a-window-in-time" class="section level3" number="1.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> <em>A Window in Time</em></h3>
<p>I lived in my extended family’s newly built house on my family’s land located in the upper Poudre Canyon for the first year of my fieldwork, from June 2022 to June 2023. The old house and surrounding land had been burned over in the CPF on one of three days of extreme firespread, all driven by strong winds. Living on my family’s land for a year was a way to look through a window in time. If over the majority of my life, the landscape in the Poudre had appeared stable, changes barely discernible to the human eye, now I could see and hear and sense massive, rapid changes in real time. It is not unusual for anthropologists to engage with their senses as part of participant observation. The classic anthropological approach is characterized by an attunement to the cultural significance of the senses <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pinkReSensingParticipantObservation2012"><strong>pinkReSensingParticipantObservation2012?</strong></a>)</span>, a sensing of the environment in the context of the people within it <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingWhenThingsWe2019">A. Tsing 2019</a>: 229)</span>. Knowledge production among scientists is also mediated through “sensory engagement” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-oreillySensingIceField2016"><strong>oreillySensingIceField2016?</strong></a>)</span> with the data being observed and collected. In the summer of 2022, my senses were largely attuned to the more than human world <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-abramSpellSensuousPerception1996"><strong>abramSpellSensuousPerception1996?</strong></a>)</span> outside my door.</p>
<p>The anthropologist Anna Tsing encourages other anthropologists to consider the “liveliness” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingWhenThingsWe2019">A. Tsing 2019, 222</a>)</span> of material, of nonhuman relations, in the things we study as a way of contributing to a more than human anthropology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingMorethanHumanSocialityCall2013"><strong>tsingMorethanHumanSocialityCall2013?</strong></a>)</span>. In her research on the political economy of the matsutake mushroom <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingMushroomEndWorld2015">A. Tsing 2015</a>)</span>, Tsing immersed herself in the forest landscapes where the mushrooms grow, and in learning about their ecology as well as the social and economic contexts in which they are harvested. Based on her experiences, there are three methodological interventions Tsing recommends for dissecting the materiality of the things we study, all of which resonate with my own approach to fieldwork and the importance I attributed to being a participant observer of the ecological, geological, and social formations in a post-wildfire landscape. These interventions are: direct observation of human and nonhuman materiality; an attention “to time as a way of identifying both human and nonhuman responsiveness” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingWhenThingsWe2019">A. Tsing 2019, 229</a>)</span>; and situating ethnographic research in a particular landscape. “A landscape is the sediment of human and nonhuman activities, biotic and abiotic, both meaningful and constructed without intent. Landscapes are active lifeworlds, held by material traces and legacies, yet open to emerging forms and possibilities” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingWhenThingsWe2019">A. Tsing 2019, 230</a>)</span>. My fieldwork and my methodological engagements reflect this focus, underscoring my conceptualization of wildfires as temporal and spatial phenomena to understand the material entanglements, modes of agency, and processes of governance that condition (and constrain) them.</p>
<p>I was anchored to the new house the first summer of my fieldwork rather than primarily out in the community due to a number of factors. There was so much work yet to be done on the house for it to pass final inspection, and the more I contributed, the faster it would get done. Limiting my radius to the house and the land around it in the first few months of my fieldwork had the benefit of concentrating my attention on the animating flows, processes, and substances <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ingoldBeingAliveEssays2011">Ingold 2011</a>)</span> of a post-wildfire environment, which resulted in a rich embodied engagement with landscape. Following Tsing <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingWhenThingsWe2019">A. Tsing 2019</a>)</span> and Ingold <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ingoldBeingAliveEssays2011">Ingold 2011</a>)</span>, I employ landscape both theoretically and empirically in my research by engaging directly with the materiality of the human and more than human lifeworlds and histories in the Poudre Canyon <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-braceHumanGeographiesClimate2010"><strong>braceHumanGeographiesClimate2010?</strong></a>)</span>. This approach manifested in four ways methodologically: first, in my experiences as an active observer and explorer of the post-fire terrain of my family’s land and adjacent USFS lands throughout the upper Poudre; second, using my family’s land as the basis for walking interviews with practitioners and scientists; third, conducting interviews in participants’ homes, where properties had been variously impacted by fire and/or flood and recovery activities; and fourth, accompanying scientists in fieldwork on different tributaries throughout the Poudre River watershed. These different methodological engagements with landscape contributed to exploration of my research questions along with my own sensemaking. Along with those I interviewed, part of my own reckoning with wildfire, and associated processes like debris flows, has been in disassembling these phenomena as both mechanisms of destruction and as ecologically necessary and beneficial.</p>

</div>
<p>On four different occasions during the summer of 2022, I was witness to extraordinary flooding events, as if the land had been cleaved open to let loose a deluge of water and sediment and boulders (see Figure 2). Most of the channels in the Poudre Canyon — a channel is a defined path created by the flow of water and sediment — formed during the last Ice Age, about 18,000 years ago, according to a fluvial geomorphologist who designed post-fire flood mitigation structures in the Poudre. Although in my lifetime I had never observed any of the channels that come off the steep mountainside adjacent to our land to carry water in them, the existence of channels indicates the flow of water in geological time and the certainty of future flow. Whether channels flood with water and sediment or with debris, resulting in a debris flow, depends on how much debris has accumulated in the channel over hundreds or thousands of years through the process of erosion, aided by gravity, enacting its “primary agency” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gordilloGravityPrimacyTerrain2020"><strong>gordilloGravityPrimacyTerrain2020?</strong></a>)</span> on the terrain. In the days following each flooding event in the summer of 2022, I hiked to every channel and sometimes to their origins up near the top of the ridgeline, to document what had tumbled down the mountain. I took hundreds of photos, organized these in photo albums, and labeled each one. Later, this documentation became useful to a couple of geologists at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) who study landslides and debris flows. They were able to use my photos to verify debris flows had occurred on a particular date and cross-reference these with data from the nearest rain gauge to develop a metric of debris flow susceptibility.</p>
<p>This was not the only data gathering I participated in on behalf of other researchers. These activities benefited my own engagement with the material world, my familiarity with different kinds of research which intersected with wildfire in some way, and my own curiosity. I collected water samples for research on the biogeochemistry of post-wildfire watersheds; documented how flooding impacted installed flood mitigation structures through photos and emails for the consulting company who had designed the installations; and reported flash floods to the National Weather Service (NWS) as a weather spotter. I also facilitated connections between people. I put researchers in touch with landowners and landowners in touch with flood mitigation specialists; I connected a person installing beaver mimicry structures — intentionally placed wood mimicking beaver dams, which catch sediment and slow down the flow of water — and facilitating beaver habitat recovery with a wildlife biologist who is tasked with removing “problem beavers”. The thought was that the problem beavers could be relocated to areas where beavers would aid riparian recovery.</p>
<p>USGS geologists, along with a geologist from the Colorado Geological Survey, came in the summer of 2023 to visit my family’s land and another site farther up the canyon, to see debris flow deposits in person. At the bottom of one of the channels, there was a large boulder perched on the edge of a steeper chute below it. From the house, the boulder looks poised to fall, and I remember watching it the summer before each time there was flow down the channel, waiting for it to spill down the channel. But it never did. “That one will go in the next hundred years,” one of the USGS geologists said glibly as we bushwhacked our way out of the aspen grove. Geology time, I thought. Along with mapping emergent plant species, mapping flood events became another aspect of my fieldwork in the summer of 2022, documentation which enabled my participation “in the world’s transformation of itself” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ingoldBeingAliveEssays2011">Ingold 2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>I shared, with my neighbors and interview participants, a continued engagement in sensemaking in relation to the transformed landscape of the Poudre Canyon. Post-wildfire, senses of place are reformulated based on an ongoing, more tenuous relationship with the environment. Following transformative and sometimes destructive wildfires and flooding, sense of place is often disrupted <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020"><strong>schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020?</strong></a>)</span>. One person lost her cabin that had been in their family for four decades during a catastrophic and deadly debris flow, which rendered the area where their cabin used to be unrecognizable. Talking about the difficulty of reconciling her relationship to place before and after the debris flow, she said “sometimes it’s almost a strange feeling because I feel like I have two memories now. I still remember this place, from childhood, growing up, and even just a few years ago, and then having to reconcile that with, it doesn’t exist. It no longer exists” (November 2022).</p>

<p>My focus was continuously drawn to the weather, along with others in the Poudre, particularly those who live close to tributaries with potential for flooding. My neighbors and I exchanged information sources for emergency alerts and sent texts to each other tracking rain gauges on an interactive map which the county made available in 2023. How we interact with and experience the weather, which manifests within specific environmental contexts <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-endfieldClimateCulturalHeritage2015"><strong>endfieldClimateCulturalHeritage2015?</strong></a>)</span>, is part of the process of reconciliation with a landscape we are coming to know again. Weather is an agentive force <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-dewitTranslatingClimateChange2018"><strong>dewitTranslatingClimateChange2018?</strong></a>)</span> in the context of the wildfire which burned through this canyon and in the ongoing flooding events different members of the community experience. Over the summers of 2022 and 2023, I became a compulsive observer of the western skies out the windows, wondering with trepidation what that day might bring. I am reminded, in my behavior, of the anthropologist Frida Hastrup’s description of survivors in a tsunami-affected village in South India, who seemed “suspended in a matrix made of the presence of disaster and the absence of certainty” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hastrupMaterializationsDisasterRecovering2010"><strong>hastrupMaterializationsDisasterRecovering2010?</strong></a>)</span>. This hyperfocus on weather, in concert with muddying my boots exploring the terrain after a flooding event, helped me better understand experiences of risk and vulnerability in a dynamic, familiar-turned-unfamiliar landscape. My sensory engagement with this landscape undergoing rapid changes helped build a sense of intimacy with this new world, and the hazards associated with it, what I refer to as recalibration in Chapter 4.</p>

<p>My approach to being in, on, and around the landscapes of the Poudre were informed by the way I affectively encountered the world, which is simultaneously experiential, classificatory, and emotional. Walking in areas of the CPF burn area with different subject matter experts, whether fire managers or fluvial geomorphologists, provided me with fresh perspectives on forest ecologies, on ecological functions of flooding, and contemporary forest management practices. My deeply situated and embodied landscape-based approach was also methodologically important for engaging with the materiality and temporality of wildfire and the cascading hazards affecting ecological processes and people’s lives.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Engaging With ‘Experts’: Walking and Talking with Researchers, Scientists, and Fire Practitioners</h3>
<p>When deciding to live on my family’s land for a year during my fieldwork, I had not anticipated that the land itself — and the water running through it — would be the basis for walking conversations about matters of interest to scientists and an enticement in and of itself for those studying aspects of post-wildfire recovery. In my introductory emails to fire and water managers and forest and fire ecologists and geologists, I described what had happened to my family’s house and the trees on our land and the subsequent flooding on our creek. Along with the choices of meeting over Zoom or traveling myself to meet them in person, I also offered prospective interviewees the option to meet at my family’s place. Of the fifty interviews I conducted, eleven were conducted at Pinehurst, and several other scientists I did not interview subsequently visited my family’s land, to examine debris flow deposits or to observe the way the fire had behaved in different areas, resulting in the death or survival of certain trees. Thus my family’s land, and the way in which fire and flood had interacted with it, became a part of my own methodology, intertwined with the way it was part of the methodology for others who initiated research there before or after our in situ meetings.</p>
<p>I met a fluvial geomorphologist and professor of geology at Colorado State University at my family’s place one afternoon in June 2023, a day after a significant flooding event on Sheep Creek, whose headwaters originate on Forest Service land before it flows through our neighbor’s land and then our land in its lower reaches before emptying into the Poudre River. Having never been to my family’s land before, she was able to apprehend material flows and processes at a glance and convey different ways of interpreting the landscape to understand, on a geological time scale, what had occurred in the past and what was currently underway. At one point on our walk along the creek, in a wider part of the valley where there was a large depositional zone (meaning the width of the channel was largely cobble and finer sediment), she pointed out what she called the “birth of a new channel.” This new channel had diverted to the side once the water hit the wide depositional area. We could see water coursing through live vegetation without any sign of the formation of stream banks yet.</p>
<p>I walked my family’s land with a number of scientists and practitioners, outlined in Table 1 below. I refer to these as walking conversations, which are semi-structured interviews designed to use place, movement, and landscape to prompt connections and meaning to the surrounding environment <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-evansWalkingInterviewMethodology2011"><strong>evansWalkingInterviewMethodology2011?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-evansGroundingKnowledgeWalking2009"><strong>evansGroundingKnowledgeWalking2009?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-berroetaPlaceSubjectivityContinuum2021"><strong>berroetaPlaceSubjectivityContinuum2021?</strong></a>)</span>, in which “the complex surface of the ground is inextricably caught up in the very process of thinking and knowing” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ingoldFootprintsWeatherworldWalking2010">Ingold 2010</a>: S135)</span>. Of the thirteen people listed here, I interviewed eight. In some cases our walking conversations supplemented more formal, recorded conversations. In the cases where no formal interview occurred, these walking conversations constituted a particular kind of participant observation, with landscape as its basis. Subject matter experts engage in sensemaking, too, both through the lens of their knowledge production and their own personal experiences with fire and forests and flood. These walks were a window into their work and their worldviews. All of these interactions opened up a new way for me to see and experience my family’s land and post-wildfire landscapes in general, a kind of recalibration of my previous knowledge holdings.</p>

<p>Not only did researchers and scientists walk my family’s land with me, I also joined some of them in their fieldwork and in some cases contributed to data collection. One example of the latter case, which is ongoing, is to collect monthly water samples from the creek which runs through my family’s land which is then analyzed by biogeochemists at the USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) out of Fort Collins. Volunteer coordination is managed through a nonprofit called the Coalition for the Poudre River Watershed (CPRW). This research helps water supply managers in Fort Collins and Greeley on the Front Range prepare for future wildfire and water quality mitigation plans and also helps evaluate post-wildfire watershed treatment strategies.</p>

<p>On multiple other occasions, I accompanied field crews to collect data for different scientific research endeavors. These trips were opportunities for me as an ethnographer to engage in “embodied learning” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-maslenNarrativePracticeStorytelling2022"><strong>maslenNarrativePracticeStorytelling2022?</strong></a>)</span>, what is referred to as the go-along method <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-carpianoComeTakeWalk2009"><strong>carpianoComeTakeWalk2009?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-kusenbachStreetPhenomenologyGoAlong2003"><strong>kusenbachStreetPhenomenologyGoAlong2003?</strong></a>)</span>.

<p>On one of the days I accompanied scientists in their field research, I joined two fluvial geomorphologists — someone who studies the movement of rivers over time and how they shape landforms — who were conducting a watershed survey to determine what geomorphic factors contribute to watershed resiliency to wildfire. They collected empirical data about the tributary we walked from top to bottom, counting the number of channel jams — in-stream piles of wood — and floodplain jams — piles of wood deposited outside of the channel on the floodplain — as measured within a defined reach. A reach is a segment of stream defined by its characteristics. I learned that one of the ways that streams are resilient is in their complexity, conceptualized as the numbers of beads along a string <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wohlRiverBeadsConceptual2018"><strong>wohlRiverBeadsConceptual2018?</strong></a>)</span>. A stream that is mostly string has less complexity than a stream with lots of beads, which may be areas of sinuosity, beaver dams, multiple channels, and other mechanisms that facilitate vertical and horizontal connectivity in a stream, such as log jams and piles of wood deposited on the floodplains. Floods or debris flows can also facilitate greater complexity and introduce beads into the system, at the same time that they can create longer strings by blowing out areas of greater complexity.</p>

<p>Part of my process of knowing wildfire and its ecological linkages is facilitated by accompanying people like the fluvial geomorphologists, moving across a landscape or through a waterway paying attention to things I previously did not know how to ascertain. “To physically move through land, by these various means, is also to travel through time and connect with the past. In other words, landscape binds up the past and present, and variously structures (pre-)history and holds knowledge” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-evansGroundingKnowledgeWalking2009"><strong>evansGroundingKnowledgeWalking2009?</strong></a> 194)</span>. Understanding the ecologically beneficial aspects of wildfire and flooding — which include benefits for human lives — and contextualizing these processes within their own timescales are two different processes of learning to see. They also happen successively. The wildfire sweeps across the land, transforming it in its wake. Long before one becomes familiar with this landscape altered by fire, it is transfigured yet again by flooding, in entirely new and devastating ways, at least for human lives and the built environment. As human beings with memories and experiences situated in a particular kind of landscape unscathed by a wildfire the scale of Cameron Peak Fire, it takes time to become situated again. For some, this adjustment never happens. One woman who used to live in the Upper Poudre as an adult and whose family sold their cabin in 2023, in the family since the 1960s, no longer considered the canyon beautiful after the burn, one of the ways she reconciled selling their family home.</p>
<p>Walking over debris fields and in stream channels and over logs with researchers and scientists rendered the landscapes of the Poudre Canyon and surrounding areas as a ‘lived phenomenon’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cresswellLandscapeObliterationPractice2003">Cresswell 2003</a>: 281)</span>, as unfinished, embodied, and practiced, where my previous life experiences had rendered it fixed both in imagination and experience. This is perhaps because the way in which we “come into relations with other things conditions what we know about them” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-root-bernsteinThingsThatAre2019"><strong>root-bernsteinThingsThatAre2019?</strong></a>)</span>. My explorations of my family’s land and my participation in different kinds of fieldwork in other watersheds helped me conciliate my visceral experiences of fire and flood as destructive forces with an appreciation for their ecological and geomorphic functions in their own right, in a manner that both transcends the human experience and intersects with it in complicated ways, simultaneously beneficial and disastrous.</p>
<p>Undeniably, wildfires and flooding can have devastating consequences for people’s lives at the same time that they can be not only ecologically beneficial over time but ecologically necessary, in ways that also benefit human beings. Part of my methodological approach, rooted in walking and talking with subject matter experts, helped me locate my life history and my family’s history within the context of the multiple materialities, temporalities, and agencies of ecologies, terrain, weather, climate, and human actors. It enabled me to see the landscape beyond the context of my own life experiences and observations before the fire and to understand it within the context of its own ecological and geological histories and patterns and through the lens of other knowledge systems and worldviews.</p>
</div>
<div id="community-involvement" class="section level3" number="1.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Community Involvement</h3>
<p>I intended for my participation in the community to be diverse and to know people in as many ways as possible. The nature of doing my fieldwork in a sparsely populated, rural area with few services necessarily limited the ways in which I could be in community. The entire Poudre Canyon has a full-time population of 750 residents stretched over forty miles, with 1,500 residents in the summer <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Us2024"><strong>Us2024?</strong></a>)</span>. The two main centers of population, one in the lower canyon and one in the upper, are nearly forty minutes apart by car. My fieldwork was mainly focused in the upper Poudre because only this part of the canyon was impacted by the Cameron Peak Fire. The lower Poudre was heavily affected by the High Park Fire in 2012. I interviewed several people who live or used to live in the lower Poudre and came to know others through another form of involvement, which was volunteering for the PCFPD. I discuss this further in the next section.</p>
<p>I participated in most scheduled gatherings in the upper Poudre throughout the course of my fieldwork. These include two monthly meetings, one for the Fire Board, and one for a member-based community organization that has been around for decades. This organization typically holds an annual fair. There are weekly chapel services from April to September, and services held at a private home the rest of the year. I never attended the latter and attended a handful of the former. Game night is also held weekly. There is one restaurant in the upper Poudre, where a weekly community breakfast is held, which I attended regularly for a period of time, but I failed to make it to karaoke held in the bar on certain nights. Women gather monthly for bookclub, and weekly for Ladies Tea, previously known as Peacemakers and primarily a craft group. Men meet for Men’s Coffee on a weekly basis. Aside from regularly scheduled social activities, there were intermittent gatherings to cut firewood for those in need, to help a neighbor whose family shrine was heavily damaged in the CPF, a pie social, and a community work day to remove fuels (i.e. dead or living vegetation) from around a cluster of community buildings, among other things. All of these activities enabled me to speak with people about their perspectives and experiences related to the fire and post-wildfire flooding, especially those people whom I did not interview.</p>
</div>
<div id="demographics" class="section level3" number="1.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Demographics</h3>
<p>It is difficult to collect demographic data systematically in the Poudre Canyon because though there are several areas with clusters of houses, many other homes and the people who own them are stretched longitudinally over many miles, obscured by trees, located over private bridges, or otherwise inaccessible to a roaming anthropologist. My familiarity with those in the upper Poudre community is limited by my prior acquaintance with families whose histories have intertwined generationally with my own, by who chooses to attend structured social events, by my involvement with the PCFPD, and by the multiple places I resided over more than two years, where I met people who live in different areas of the upper Poudre. Aside from the community center and chapel, there are few places for people to gather socially. There are just two restaurants the entire forty-mile length of the canyon, spaced about a half hour’s drive apart. There is no longer a school. The one-room schoolhouse which my sister and cousins attended was closed by the school district in 1994. When my mother was a child, there were multiple other families with children, and this was true, albeit to a lesser extent, when I was a child, too. Today, the upper Poudre is primarily a retirement community on fixed incomes. It is almost entirely white and English speaking, with a handful of exceptions. To my knowledge, there are a handful of people who live here and continue to work full-time, remotely, as commuters, and with local jobs. Local work includes construction, restaurant work, garbage service, custom ammunition supply, and resort ownership. Retirees’ former jobs include plumber, nurse, administrative assistant, engineer, and firefighter, among others. There are five resorts and one commercial campground in the upper Poudre, one which includes the only restaurant. This resort also has an RV park, and some of the RV campers work part-time at the store or clean cabins in exchange for a place to stay. Four of these resorts have storefronts with fishing gear, snacks, and essentials such as milk. All of them have cabins to rent, with two resorts offering a rustic cabin experience with some of the cabins dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s. When the commercial campground was put in, sometime in my late teens, they installed a security light which could be seen from my family’s house and our neighbor’s house across the valley, the first source of real light pollution in this part of the canyon. In response, my neighbor began live trapping packrats — a rodent which finds its way into homes and sheds and builds large, odorous prickly nests — and releasing them near the campground in a hilarious but futile form of passive protest.</p>
<p>There are a disproportionate number of second homes to primary homes, although I do not know exactly how many. Unlike in many mountainous communities in Colorado, the majority of second home owners here are not affluent, just like the majority of residents are not high income. It is neither an impoverished — there are certainly a few individuals who are very poor — nor a rich community. There are few new homes being built because of the lack of new real estate, and one won’t find in the upper Poudre multi-million dollar homes typical of many mountain communities in Colorado today <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-blevinsSourceColoradosHigh2022"><strong>blevinsSourceColoradosHigh2022?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-MountainMigrationReport2021"><strong>MountainMigrationReport2021?</strong></a>)</span>. Along with significant settlement in the late 1800s, the next largest influx of homes followed the sale of a cattle-turned-dude ranch in the 1960s, which was subsequently subdivided. The majority of homes originate from these two eras, with a smattering of others being built since then. Moreover, it has always been a community consisting of a good percentage of second homes, dating back again to the late 1800s. During the initial years of colonial settlement in the mid- to late 1800s, this community was composed of ranchers, fur trappers, miners, tie-cutters, construction workers, business owners, and people who retreated to the mountains from Denver or Fort Collins or Kansas or Nebraska for respite. During my mother’s youth, there were several other families with children her age who spent their summers in the Poudre like she and her sisters did, other children whose parents were ministers or, like hers, teachers. This pattern of retreating to the mountains was typical of other mountain canyons near the Front Range of Colorado, where most of the state’s population resides in cities. Unlike these other canyons, the Poudre has not grown exponentially and has remained a mountain residence and retreat largely for the middle class. This may be changing. Housing prices have, in accordance with the rise of costs around the state and an exponential hike in property taxes in Larimer County, begun to increase dramatically in the last few years. Recently a real estate investment firm purchased a large tract of land from a longtime family in the upper Poudre, and I learned from a construction worker there that they have purchased several other properties in the Poudre as well. It is difficult to foresee what their plan might be.</p>
<p>Although I do not know the histories of other mountain canyons in Colorado, I believe something unique to the upper Poudre is the longevity of connection to this place over generations. There are at least nine families and their descendants who have been in the Poudre since the late 1800s and continue to reside here, have generational family homes, or operate a resort. There are numerous other families who have had a presence here since the 1940s, 50s, and 60s and numerous others who have been visiting here routinely since their childhoods and chose to retire here, building a home or purchasing one. Still others have never lived here but have continued to return over the course of their lives to stay at one of the resorts and fish or hike or gather with family in the mountains, something I did not realize before I began living here full-time over two years ago. I recently learned of someone who has reserved an RV campsite at one of the resorts for thirty years.</p>
<p>New commercial development is severely limited by the county, which contributes to an overall sense among residents that the county, and the USFS, would prefer people do not live here. This is reinforced by decisions made by these different government actors with no visible presence here which greatly impact the lives of people in the Poudre but over which they have no input or control. As a rural, unincorporated area, the Poudre is administered by Larimer County with the oversight of three elected county commissioners. Most in person interaction with Larimer County is through the Sheriff’s Department and Emergency Services, which is housed in the former. There is one visitor center belonging to the USFS, the largest landowner in the Poudre, which is staffed entirely by volunteers, both local and from elsewhere. A USFS archeologist is making a concerted effort to restore the cabins at the former lodge turned visitor center. Beyond this, there are few opportunities for residents in the Poudre to interact with anyone from the USFS, let alone anyone who is making decisions impacting their lives.</p>
<p>At the county level, one of the starkest examples contributing to the idea that the county does not want people to live here is the aforementioned removal of a private bridge and the lack of assistance in building a new one. Another example in relation to the USFS involves the property where the debris flow which damaged the bridge below occurred. The debris flow from the Black Hollow tributary was so massive that it changed the course of the river when it deposited trees and boulders into the river’s path. A consulting company working with a coalition funded through the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program of the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) to install flood mitigation structures was prohibited by the USFS from continuing its work. This was because the work would affect the river, sections of which were designated as Wild &amp; Scenic in 1986 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-CachePoudreWild1990"><strong>CachePoudreWild1990?</strong></a>)</span>. The USFS found that the consulting company had inadvertently not followed rules for using federal funds in relation to work that would affect a Wild &amp; Scenic-designated river and halted all work. The landowners at Black Hollow, six of whom lost their homes in the debris flow, now have a pile of boulders two stories high and a huge stack of logs with which to contend, material which sits on private property where there used to be homes, adding to the difficulty of rebuilding or selling their lots.</p>
</div>
<div id="gender-dynamics" class="section level3" number="1.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.5</span> Gender Dynamics</h3>
<p>The social structure of the upper Poudre can be old fashioned, specifically in how certain key activities are gendered. This may be due in part to the fact that most people who live in the Upper Poudre are post-retirement age, although there are perhaps a dozen people in their 40s and 50s. Although I did not survey political or religious persuasion, based on informal conversations throughout more than two years of living here, the upper Poudre leans politically conservative and religious. These may also be factors in gendered social activities. In addition to Men’s Coffee and Ladies Tea, the weekly breakfast is also gender segregated, with all the men at one table and all the women at another. This did not preclude me from interacting with and interviewing men as well as women, particularly through my involvement with the PCFPD. However, structured, regularly scheduled social activities were often organized to separate men and women, and I was excluded from certain spaces as a woman. Traditional gender roles surfaced in some areas, even while they were bucked in others. Dinner is made by different women for the fire district’s monthly training, for example, never by men. Both men and women volunteer for the district and attend the trainings and drive the emergency vehicles. Just one person, a woman, drives the water tender, a fire truck with a large capacity tank on it. Although this dissertation does not specifically include gender analysis, it was a notable part of the social relations of the upper Poudre and shaped how and when I crossed paths with different groups of people. Gender “as a culturally and politically constructed phenomenon” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ortnerFemaleMaleNature1996"><strong>ortnerFemaleMaleNature1996?</strong></a> 180)</span> is often taken for granted by anthropologists working elsewhere, particularly in the Global South <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-adhikariGenderedConsequencesSocial2022"><strong>adhikariGenderedConsequencesSocial2022?</strong></a>)</span>, but it is also the case right here at home.</p>
<p>In the Fall of 2022, I began regularly attending Ladies Tea. Most of the women brought craft projects to work on, and sometimes there were collective quilt projects, often led by the talented Jennifer. While she was evacuated from her home during the Cameron Peak Fire, living in a hotel room in Fort Collins, she created a quilt of a wildfire scene, a sky of billowy clouds of smoke over forested mountains on fire with the river coursing below.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>At Ladies Tea, conversation would sometimes drift toward talking about the wildfire or challenges with flooding people may have been experiencing. The Cameron Peak Fire, like 84% of wildfires in the U.S. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-balchHumanstartedWildfiresExpand2017"><strong>balchHumanstartedWildfiresExpand2017?</strong></a>)</span>, was likely human-started, but to date nobody has been held liable. This lends itself to a sense of uneasiness among Poudre Canyon community members about the ever present possibility of wildfires being started by careless people. One passage in my fieldnotes from October 2022 reads: “I went to Ladies Tea today, where there was a flurry of activity. Jennifer was sewing pieces on a little machine, and Marsha was helping her. Mindy had brought her earrings she makes out of buttons; Cheryl was knitting (crocheting?) Christmas stockings; Belinda was working on embroidery, as was Beverly. Paige had brought sock puppets she’d made. Rachel was working on something I couldn’t make out, and Simone and I weren’t working on anything. A man who nobody knew came through the doors and asked if the fire station was closed. He had seen smoke up Pingree Hill and wanted to report it. Paige called her husband, who is with the fire district, and he took a fire engine out to investigate. We speculated whether it might be a prescribed burn or from a campground, and Beverly and Rachel said they didn’t want any kind of fire nearby. Beverly said she thinks nobody should be allowed to have campfires anymore, and Belinda said people should have to go through training to have campfires. Simone said her daughter is the same way, thinks nobody should have campfires, and becomes anxious whenever she sees people having campfires. I doubt anyone would have felt as strongly before the Cameron Peak Fire.” Conversations about wildfire and flooding permeated all social spaces, often triggered by the prospect of danger, as in this case, spurring people to discuss their affective associations with risk.</p>
<p>One of the regular attendees at Men’s Coffee told me “I don’t know what you talk about at Ladies Tea, but we talk about putting a gate up at Stove Prairie.” Stove Prairie Road intersects the canyon about halfway between the upper Poudre and town, meaning Fort Collins. In a long tradition echoing my grandparents’ generation who joked about seceding from Larimer County, there is a predilection among many in the Upper Poudre to be able to live their lives unhindered by impositions from various levels of government. This is a complex and important topic relevant to nearly every aspect of the wildfire and ongoing recovery, and is related to the relationship I discussed in the section above. In the absence of regular presence or interaction with the jurisdictions who make consequential decisions affecting the lives of residents here, people understandably conclude government actors do not have their best interest in mind. As one person with the fire district who has lived in the area for more than thirty years put it to me, there has long been conflict between those who manage the forest and those who live in the forest.</p>
</div>
<div id="wildlife" class="section level3" number="1.2.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.6</span> Wildlife</h3>
<p>At any social gathering, the topic of conversation was often about observations and encounters with wildlife. In the summer, we often spoke about bears, who had seen them, how many cars at a resort they had broken into, who had forgotten to bring their hummingbird feeders inside at night. It was a subject everyone loved to talk about. One person recounted a story about waking up at 5am to a bear on his deck. He described shooting rubber buckshot in his underwear at the bear to scare it off, laughing as he said, referring to all of us up the Poudre, “We lead interesting lives.” Door cam videos of mountain lions and bobcats and photos of moose taken from kitchen windows made the rounds on texts and Facebook. People shared how many times they filled their hummingbird feeders in a day. There were frequent stories about who saw the family of turkeys making the rounds in a particular neighborhood. Animals, and our intimate interactions with them, symbolize the experience of wildness that accompanies living in the Poudre Canyon, a reality which most treasure and one of the reasons people choose to live here. As I discuss in Chapter 2, people also filtered their understandings of the impacts of the CPF through their observations of how wildlife movement and health were shaped by the wildfire and subsequent flooding. The sense that both phenomena were ultimately beneficial to wildlife helped people understand these ecological processes in positive terms, at least as they affected wildlife.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-dream-becomes-a-nightmare-community-member-interviews" class="section level3" number="1.2.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.7</span> <em>A Dream Becomes a Nightmare</em>: Community Member Interviews</h3>
<p>Nearly half of the fifty semi-structured interviews (twenty) I conducted were with community members, broadly defined. Like me, some of them wear multiple hats. Counted under practitioners instead of community members, seven are current or former volunteers with PCFPD, and one is a retired forest ecologist and research professor. Most of these participants live, have lived, or have spent significant parts of their lives in the Upper Poudre Canyon, although a number of participants live in proximity to the upper Poudre, either in the lower Poudre or adjacent areas where they were affected by the CPF and in some cases by the 2012 High Park Fire. I conducted interviews from September 2022 to November 2023. Five of my interviews with community members were with married couples. I interviewed a few of the community members over Zoom (one over the phone), and several came to my family’s home for the interview.</p>
<p>One of them, whose cousins I used to play with as a child, was also among the few who remained in place when the CPF tore through my family’s land across the river from his and then cast wind-tossed embers toward his house. “There wasn’t probably a square foot anywhere where embers hadn’t fallen,” he told me. He spent five hours putting out spot fires lit by the embers until he was so exhausted he couldn’t walk anymore. I have heard others up the Poudre credit him with saving the homes in his neighborhood on Labor Day 2020.</p>
<p>I met other community members at their homes to conduct the interviews, which were often illuminating visits because I was able to see for myself how they had been affected by the CPF or were being impacted by ongoing flooding. One example of this was a hike to visit my neighbors, who own a home in a small cluster of eight cabins over the river where the county removed their bridge in August 2021, discussed in a previous section. In what remains a controversial act that is currently under litigation, the county Office of Emergency Management condemned and removed the bridge, effectively isolating residents from their homes on the other side of the river, including a couple in their 70s who lived there full time. This couple’s children helped them build a kind of zipline, anchored on each side by rickety platforms on a steep, loose dirt slope. Another resident only comes up when this couple or their family will be there so she can be helped making it across on the zipline. The couple eventually had to relocate to another state.</p>
<div class="figure">

</p>
</div>
<p>Two other families drive over the bridge shared between my family and our two neighbors. They park just on the other side and hike along a rough trail along the river on our land to reach their cabin. Depending on pace and agility, it can take anywhere from fifteen minutes to a half hour, scrambling over two scree fields with large, loose boulders. This was how I got to their cabin when I interviewed them. The majority of homeowners are not physically capable of doing this hike, and some of them have never been able to return to their cabins since their bridge was demolished. When I asked a county official involved in the decision to remove the bridge about introduced public safety hazards to homeowners as a result of removing the bridge, she responded that there wasn’t a public safety concern because there were trails to get to the cabins. There is one trail, and not only are most homeowners physically unable to manage it, there are also a limited number of PCFPD volunteers who would be able to make it over the trail. It absolutely increases emergency response time, and it would be logistically complex to have to extract somebody who was physically incapacitated, requiring many hours and the use of the Larimer County Dive Rescue and Search and Rescue, all volunteer teams comprising individuals living primarily in Fort Collins or nearby towns. My own scramble over the rocks for the interview and the hike back out in the waning light of dusk was an embodied experience of the reality of these homeowners, augmented by stories and events accentuating the challenges and risks associated with no longer having easy access to one’s home, whether by vehicle or foot. Of the several wildfires which occurred during my fieldwork, one was started across the river and highway from these cabins, embers of which were then whipped up into fire by strong March winds. The wind blew embers across the river, threatening the cabins, which had survived the CPF. In the absence of a bridge, the USFS wildland firefighters were prohibited from crossing the shallow, partially frozen river on foot to reach the other side and had to wait until the Larimer County Dive Rescue team could mobilize in Fort Collins and bring up rafts to ferry the firefighters to the other side, which took several hours. In the end, all the cabins survived, but it was a stark illustration of the consequences of not having a bridge. My participation in different experiences of situatedness through visiting interviewees in their homes was central to cultivating my understanding of the diverse impacts and consequences the CPF and everything it set in motion had for people’s lives.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.8</span> Poudre Canyon Fire Protection District (PCFPD)</h3>
<p>I joined the local, rural fire district as a volunteer firefighter for several reasons. First, I wanted to be of service to the community during my fieldwork, and I knew that the fire district always needed volunteers. Second, I anticipated learning a lot about fighting wildfires in the Poudre Canyon and also about how the fire district operates in relation to other agencies, such as the USFS and Larimer County Emergency Services. Third, I knew that the PCFPD had participated in fighting the CPF during its months-long siege, and volunteering for the fire district would allow me to get to know people involved in that work. I continue to volunteer in several capacities, including responding to calls, conducting wildfire risk assessments of homes, and grant administration. My participation with the PCFPD provided a critical perspective on risk governance in relation to multi-jurisdictional hazard response, on the operations of a volunteer fire district in a rural, unincorporated region, and on how the PCFPD responds to various kinds of risk which benefits a much larger geography than the Poudre. I discuss these points in greater detail in Chapter 3 and here provide more information on the composition of the fire district and my role as participant observer.</p>
<p>The district is 99 square miles, its boundary the length of nearly forty miles along the Poudre River and extending two miles wide in some areas. There is much more rural mountainous terrain outside the district whose residents do not have their own district, and the PCFPD is the first responding agency for this additional 150 square miles <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Us2024"><strong>Us2024?</strong></a>)</span>. There are approximately thirty volunteers across four fire stations, two of them in the upper Poudre, one in the lower Poudre, and another outside of and above the canyon, reached by a steep, gravel road with switchbacks from the upper Poudre. Only some of the volunteers respond some of the time, and in the upper Poudre and adjacent area above, only eight respond consistently. Although the residential population of the canyon is quite low, it is a popular recreational area year round but especially in the fall and summer when people visit to fish, hunt, paddle, hike, and backpack in the national forest lands which make up 85% of the river corridor <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-CachePoudreWild1990"><strong>CachePoudreWild1990?</strong></a>)</span>. The PCFPD serves a much larger population than actually lives in the canyon. Though only 750-1,500 people live in the entire Poudre Canyon, it receives 500,000-800,000 visitors each year. In 2023, 75% of the calls were to assist non-residents <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-PoudreCanyonFire2024"><strong>PoudreCanyonFire2024?</strong></a>)</span>. The majority of calls to the PCFPD are either medical or vehicle accidents, not wildfires. During the time I have been a volunteer, there have only been three wildfires and three structure fires, out of nearly 200 calls. In addition to emergencies, PCFPD volunteers, including myself, also help with pile burning and wood chipping on private lands to help dispose of woody material called slash that poses a fire danger.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.2.8.1</span> Multi-jurisdictional Emergency Response</h4>
<p>Being a volunteer with the fire district situated me within a larger emergency response ecosystem. Certain calls would be beyond our capacity to control, and though we were often the first responders on the scene, we would ask for assistance from other jurisdictions, often Larimer County Emergency Services (LCES), part of the Sheriff’s department. In many jurisdictions around the western U.S., the sheriff was originally also designated as the fire marshall by statute. The Sheriff’s simultaneous position as chief law enforcement officer as well as Fire Marshall persists uniquely in Larimer County relative to other counties, where the duties of the Sheriff and responding to fire are separated. Those with whom I spoke in Emergency Services seemed to think these dual roles of the Sheriff’s department benefited the way they were able to perform their work, without artificially separating different kinds of emergencies. Emergency Management and Emergency Services are separate departments at the county, and only the latter is housed within the Sheriff’s office, along with tactical Emergency Medical Services (EMS), SWAT, Hazmat response, and avalanche and swift water rescue. There are seventy-five on-call firefighters. In instances when LCES is called in by the PCFPD to help respond to a medical emergency or to wildland fire, a process referred to as mutual aid, they usually become the Incident Command. The Incident Command System (ICS) is a hierarchical management structure divided into five functional areas to coordinate people and resources for the duration of the incident <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-u.s.nationalparkserviceWildlandFireIncident2020"><strong>u.s.nationalparkserviceWildlandFireIncident2020?</strong></a>)</span>. The ICS was originally developed to facilitate multi-agency responses to wildfires but is now used across different incidents as part of the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ICSReviewDocument2018"><strong>ICSReviewDocument2018?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>My experiences responding to emergencies as a volunteer were sometimes a tragic lesson in what it means to live in a rural, mountainous area with its accompanying risks and hazards, whether wildfire, flooding, car accidents on winding roads with few guardrails, or medical emergencies on UFSS hiking trails. Rural, unincorporated areas rely on volunteer fire departments as the first line of defense against wildfires, as the first responders to accidents and medical emergencies and flooding incidents, rather than dedicated professional emergency services. In the case of the PCFPD, volunteers disproportionately assist visitors compared to residents, frequently under circumstances which occur while driving on state or county roads or recreating on national forest lands. The topography and terrain of the Poudre Canyon and surrounding areas delineate particular hazards that don’t exist to the same extent in flatter, less forested areas of Colorado, or the country. The Poudre Canyon, as became apparent during the CPF, facilitates the spread of fire as through a funnel, driven by winds. The water obeys gravity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gordilloGravityPrimacyTerrain2020"><strong>gordilloGravityPrimacyTerrain2020?</strong></a>)</span> and flows off the steep mountainsides into the river, which travels down the confines of the canyon walls, restricted by the highway, to the plains below. The plains, however, have their own hazards and sometimes experience worse flooding than the mountains. It is not as if the mountains bear the only measures of risk. However, the relative remoteness of this area, an hour or more away from the closest city, results in real discrepancies in terms of access to services, whether emergency, phone and internet, groceries, technicians, schools, or any other matter of amenities people rely on in their daily lives. And in emergencies, the lack of access to resources is compounded.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Research Positionality and Ethical Considerations</h2>
<p>The essence of my dissertation research is to understand how people living through, researching, and managing the 2020 CPF made sense of both it and its cascading consequences. This research project is rooted in my own experiences of loss and change in a place I have known my whole life and constituted through my experiences and memories. The research process is at times akin to working on a puzzle. Each person I have spoken with about their experiences or perspectives helps me connect another piece, though it may always be an incomplete puzzle. Each piece added to the puzzle reveals more of the larger picture. Sensemaking in a post-disaster context, both the act of gaining understanding, and the sensory engagement of place, is a way of connecting memory and identity tied to past associations with a present and reformulated identity and sense of belonging <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-moultonHowRememberInterplay2015"><strong>moultonHowRememberInterplay2015?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Although this is not strictly an autoethnographic research project, my personal experiences with the wildfire, accompanying landscape changes, and the ensuing institutional processes of recovery unavoidably shape the outline of my inquiry. I join other disaster anthropologists who started off studying something else and then shifted to focusing on disasters as a result of either personal experiences with disaster or disasters occurring at their field sites <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosResilienceCommentaryVantage2016">Barrios 2016</a>; <a href="#ref-shneidermanEquivocatingHousesKinship2024"><strong>shneidermanEquivocatingHousesKinship2024?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-hoffmanWorstTimesBest2019"><strong>hoffmanWorstTimesBest2019?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-oliver-smithAnthropologicalResearchHazards1996"><strong>oliver-smithAnthropologicalResearchHazards1996?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>While certainly not new, anthropology that is autoethnographically informed raises important questions of reflexivity, alterity, and the production of anthropological knowledge. Following other scholars who have contemplated the tensions between subjectivity and objectivity in knowledge production <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gibbAnthropologistUndone2005"><strong>gibbAnthropologistUndone2005?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-navaro-yashinAffectiveSpacesMelancholic2009"><strong>navaro-yashinAffectiveSpacesMelancholic2009?</strong></a>)</span>, I understand “ethnographic truth” to be “partial, perspectival, and embedded in social material relations of power and obligation” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-finnWallsBridgesCultural2000"><strong>finnWallsBridgesCultural2000?</strong></a> 140)</span>. Further, as the anthropologist Ato Quayson points out, “alienation is a primary means by which the ethnographer is kept alert to the modes by which he or she theorizes the cultural encounter,” the experiences of which form the basis for participant observation. In this research, which is also personal, I needed to be aware of the risk of hierarchizing certain knowledges and feelings, and “rigorously conscious” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-quaysonCalibrationsReadingSocial2003"><strong>quaysonCalibrationsReadingSocial2003?</strong></a> 29)</span> of my assumptions. This meant that I had to constantly recalibrate and engage with the experience of alienation in a familiar, now not-so-familiar, landscape and culture.</p>
<p>One way of approaching ethnography in which the researcher becomes affected, as I have been by my experiences of the fire and by the associated loss, requires accommodating a “form of split experience” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-favret-saadaBeingAffected2012"><strong>favret-saadaBeingAffected2012?</strong></a> 443)</span>. Another way is to apply a particular conceptualization of alienation to my research approach — the alienation effect — as theorized by Bertolt Brecht who used this phrase to characterize the process of drawing the attention of a theatre audience toward something familiar in order to see it in a new and critical light <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brechtBertoltBrechtJournals2020"><strong>brechtBertoltBrechtJournals2020?</strong></a> 81)</span>. The wildfire serves as an alienation effect, causing me to view, experience, and interrogate the social and environmental landscape histories of the Poudre Canyon in an entirely different way, one that lays out a path for an anthropological inquiry.</p>
<p>My own experiences with the 2020 CPF positions me as an anthropologist with an insider perspective of the impacts of wildfires on senses of place, identity, and belonging. It also offers me insight into the complex institutional recovery processes associated with insurance claims alongside county, state, and federal response mechanisms as my family continues to navigate these processes. My closeness to this ongoing disaster has both positive and negative implications and is in itself an ethical consideration. My insider knowledge of the various actors and governing structures provide considerable insight into processes about which I might be otherwise unaware or simply observing. Various aspects of my identity have lent credibility to my role within the community, beyond experiencing loss due to the wildfire, such as my own family’s long presence in the Poudre Canyon or my role as a volunteer with the PCFPD.</p>
<p>Throughout my fieldwork, I became more aware of how my experiences, emotional attachments, and political opinions may lead to unwitting bias in my communications with community members or government officials. As a researcher, landowner, and volunteer firefighter, I frequently found myself wearing multiple hats, which required that I make space for a number of different perspectives, both within myself and in relation to others. Wearing multiple hats as a researcher, or occupying “multiple role relationships” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-collinsCommunitybasedParticipatoryResearch2018"><strong>collinsCommunitybasedParticipatoryResearch2018?</strong></a>)</span> is a common phenomenon in qualitative research <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-raheimResearcherResearchedRelationship2016"><strong>raheimResearcherResearchedRelationship2016?</strong></a>)</span> writ large and in public anthropology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-irvinePublicAnthropologyField2012"><strong>irvinePublicAnthropologyField2012?</strong></a>)</span>, critical ethnography, and applied anthropology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ryderCriticalEthnographyResearch2021"><strong>ryderCriticalEthnographyResearch2021?</strong></a>)</span> more specifically. This is in part because researchers in these subdisciplines are often acting in service to the communities in which they are conducting their research. Volunteering or playing a specific role in a community beyond just that of a researcher is also a way to engage participants in ways that transcend transactional relationships <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ryderCriticalEthnographyResearch2021"><strong>ryderCriticalEthnographyResearch2021?</strong></a>)</span> and create a foundation for longer term engagement that goes beyond the fieldwork period. A researcher who has a number of different roles in a community, similar to a researcher engaging in autoethnography, requires careful consideration of positionality and a willingness to be self-reflexive.</p>
<p>My own plural positionalities were brought to my attention most clearly when I attended the Colorado Wildland Fire Conference in April 2023. Many of the people in attendance were fire practitioners, meaning they are members of nonprofits or county, state, or federal agencies working on wildfire prevention, fuels treatments — meaning some combination of forest thinning and prescribed fire — and providing homeowners with information about making their homes less susceptible to burning down because of a wildfire, among other things. As a researcher, and as a practitioner of sorts, it was interesting to be exposed to the world of practitioners and managers and to the ways in which they are all versed in the same way of speaking. As a landowner — and as a researcher — I sometimes felt like a fly on a wall.</p>
<p>Attending this particular conference, which was the first of several wildfire, climate, or hazard-related conferences I attended in the state, taught me that in Colorado, the world of people who work in wildfire risk reduction, management, and watershed recovery is a small, intimate network of people. This is a testament to the successful collaborations formed by agencies and organizations operating within different jurisdictions. It was also an indication that I needed to be sensitive to the closeness of these relationships among professionals in my research and interviews, although I put my foot in my mouth more than once.</p>
<p>By way of example, before I arrived in Colorado, I virtually attended a meeting in a nearby community to listen in on a discussion of the results of a Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP). I came away with the impression that the young facilitator (from a nonprofit which had helped put together the CWPP) who lives in the city (Fort Collins) was patronizing toward a primarily retirement-age crowd who live in an area considered the wildland urban interface (WUI), a term I problematize in Chapter 3. The WUI is considered the area where development interfaces with fire-adapted landscapes. There are many reasons why the term WUI is problematic, which I detail in Chapter 3, but given its widespread use in fire practitioner worlds and in the literature about wildfire risk <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vaskeSalientValueSimilarity2007"><strong>vaskeSalientValueSimilarity2007?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-weiEstimatingWUIExposure2023"><strong>weiEstimatingWUIExposure2023?</strong></a>)</span>, there are surprisingly few critiques of the concept and term. This fact is emblematic of how narratives about wildfire and the communities who are exposed to wildfire risk are entrenched and discursively regurgitated by practitioners, managers, and scientists alike. A retired social scientist with the U.S.F.S. is one of few if not the only researcher publicly critiquing the WUI and its underlying assumptions, one of which is a tacit judgement of those who choose to live in areas where wildfires can occur. “Where are people supposed to live then?” is one question she poses <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mccaffreyFireNarrativesAre2018a"><strong>mccaffreyFireNarrativesAre2018a?</strong></a>)</span>, considering how many landscapes in the U.S. are fire-adapted, the presence of different kinds of hazards in nearly every place people live, and the complex reasons people live where they do. This meeting I observed was one of the first times I heard the language of “personal responsibility” being used in practice, by which I mean the facilitator communicated to the older crowd of people that they needed to take responsibility for living in an area with wildfire risk in the context of implementing the action items to reduce risk identified in the CWPP. I wanted to further examine this set of relations between institutionalized risk reduction and communities as a researcher — which I do in Chapter 3 — but I also bristled at the condescension I perceived as a landowner in the WUI. Months later, after I had begun my fieldwork in Colorado, I met with two representatives of another nonprofit and in the context of our conversation about CWPPs, I mentioned the patronizing dynamic between facilitator and the community I had observed. I realized shortly after this, after attending the aforementioned conference, that these two nonprofits were closely aligned and that all the individuals in question work closely together. This was one of many uncomfortable experiences learning how to settle into my multiple roles and coming to terms with my positionality in conducting research for this project. My position is unique because of the personal ways I am connected to my research topic, and the complex ways I simultaneously occupy insider and outsider roles.</p>
<div id="interviews-and-other-forms-of-data-collection" class="section level4" number="1.3.0.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.0.1</span> Interviews And Other Forms of Data Collection</h4>
<p>Social, economic, and emotional losses due to wildfires, forest management, wildfire policies, and climate change are all emotionally laden topics and at the same time, deeply political. I was sensitive to how people may have felt discussing wildfire policy and governance with a researcher — and landowner, for that matter — although I heard no indication of concern from participants. I sought consent from each participant using consent forms, in compliance with the requirements of the UBC Behavioral Research Ethics Board (# H22-01084). Most people signed the consent forms, while some of those I interviewed over Zoom opted to provide verbal consent instead. Of the fifty interviews I conducted, only two people opted not to be recorded, although due to technical issues with the recorder or disruptive background noise, a total of six interviews were not recorded. Throughout this dissertation, I have only used pseudonyms where I refer to people by name. Although only two people I interviewed explicitly wished to remain anonymous, I chose not to use real names because of the political nature of wildfire governance and recovery, the closeness of the different actors involved (especially scientists and practitioners), and because I hope my research will be published in journal articles aimed at diverse audiences, some of whom would recognize each other if named. It felt more ethical to maintain anonymity for all these reasons.</p>
<p>Another situation that required transparency around collecting information was when I was the convener of an activity. This included two community tours and invited presentations. As a UBC Public Scholar, I was fortunate to receive additional funding from the Climate Emergency Fund (CEF). The purpose of this funding was separate from the goals of my research and was focused on facilitating community discussions related to hazards, some of which had been introduced by the wildfire and some of which were pre-existing. Using this funding, I organized community presentations by four speakers, three fluvial geomorphologists , a forest ecologist, and a local amateur historian. Their presentations functioned as a form of facilitated, collective sensemaking, or at least this was my intention in bringing in experts to speak about their research in wildfire, the study of streams and rivers, or their work in mitigating flooding.</p>
<p>In August 2023, I organized The Future of Forest Service Fuels Treatments Tour with the help of a Fire Management Planning Specialist with the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest — the name of the national forest in the Poudre Canyon and surrounding areas — a representative from The Ember Alliance, a nationwide nonprofit focused on community planning for wildfires; and the Larimer Conservation District, one of 74 conservation districts in Colorado. I later joined the Board of Directors of The Ember Alliance.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>I also coordinated a Post-Wildfire Flooding Tour for community members in September 2023, facilitated by a fluvial geomorphologist with a consulting firm who had designed all of the flood mitigation structures we visited. The purpose of these tours were twofold. First, I wanted to provide an opportunity to community members who had not directly experienced flooding to visit other community members’ homes to see firsthand how flooding or debris flows were impacting them or altering the environment around their homes, led by the person who had designed flood mitigation at all of these sites.</p>
<p>Second, from my position of access as a researcher, I wanted to facilitate relationship building opportunities between community members and representatives from the USFS, the largest landowner in the canyon. Residents of the Poudre live on parcels of private lands surrounded by federal land (and some state), and this arrangement informs the way people perceive the USFS and its management of forests and the river, or inactions. For complicated reasons, the USFS is largely an invisible “feudal landlord” (a term borrowed from a presentation by landscape architect Jacob Heydorn Gorski who quoted a community member from a nearby area referring to the USFS). Most USFS employees live in Fort Collins even if they physically work on the Forest, and there are few opportunities for interaction with community members, especially among those employees implementing wildfire-related plans. The USFS has a working relationship with the PCFPD, and leadership in the fire district is more familiar with their activities relative to the rest of the community because they are frequently notified of them. If the USFS is doing a prescribed burn, for example, it will let PCFPD know in case the district receives calls about wildfire smoke. Of the community members on the fuels treatments tour, only those who are members of the PCFPD had prior knowledge of the two treatments we visited. Of course these convening activities were relevant for my research, even if they were organized with different objectives, and required careful consideration in terms of how I engaged with some of the material and people with whom my research brought me into contact.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="chapter-overview" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Chapter Overview</h2>
<p>The following three chapters are structured as standalone journal articles, in various stages of submission. Each of the three chapters contains its own literature review and references, as does Chapter 1, the Introduction, and Chapter 5, the Conclusion.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, I draw on the geological concept of cascading hazards and the ecological concept of a disturbance cascade to highlight how people and landscapes in the Poudre Canyon are concurrently subject to cascading impacts during and after a wildfire. Based on the lived experiences of those in the Poudre and nearby areas, I reflect on the ways people are affected by wildfire that is not easily enumerated and therefore less visible to the public and entities involved in recovery.</p>
<p>I discuss what it means to live with fire in Chapter 3 and show how conceptualizations of those who live in fire-adapted landscapes is misguided. Drawing on examples from the Poudre Canyon, I demonstrate that people in rural, unincorporated communities exposed to wildfire risk are potential stewards of their communities and the environments in which they live, and play important roles in responding to hazards. In the case of the Poudre, different forms of hazard mitigation at the community level benefits not only residents but also the hundreds of thousands of visitors to the canyon each year as well as water users in populous cities downstream.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, I describe how community members, practitioners, and scientists go through various stages of sensemaking in response to the CPF and other extreme wildfires. I draw generously on the words of participants themselves to underscore how sensemaking helps recalibrate understandings of risk, agency, control, and impermanence in relation to the forces of fire and flood. Using long-form quotations, I show how recalibration as a result of sensemaking is remarkably similar across the three interview groups. A recalibrated understanding of wildfire and flooding rooted in an appreciation of these phenomena as ecologically integral to the lifecycles and timescales of the material formations of the Poudre Canyon seems to lead to a level of acceptance of wildfire, even of its most destructive forces.</p>
<p>Finally, in Chapter 5, I reflect on my research questions and the findings highlighted in the previous three chapters and discuss how this dissertation contributes to the literatures on landscape, temporality, materiality, and disaster in which I situate my work. I write about the implications of this research project for policy and for helping society navigate extreme wildfire and its cascading impacts. I also discuss the limitations of my dissertation and make suggestions for further research.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Dale had just made himself a drink on the afternoon of July 20, 2021, when the power blinked on and off, and he heard what sounded like a shotgun blast. He later attributed the sound to the destruction of an electricity transformer. He looked outside to see a power pole swinging back and forth even though there was no wind and then noticed his patio was covered in about a foot-and-a-half of mud and water. As he futilely tried to get his patio chairs out of the way, all he could think was, ‘Where is all this water coming from?’ He put his rubber boots on and made his way up through the water to what he calls ‘the shelf,’ a flat area on a hill overlooking Black Hollow Creek which flows by the home his father built.</p>
<p>The creek had grown exponentially in size and volume and created a new channel. He watched in disbelief as one of his neighbor’s homes floated away down the river. There were four people inside that home, all of whom died that day. Five other homes were destroyed, no vehicles could cross the bridge over the river for a week, and the land on which the remaining homes stood had been radically altered by the mass of trees and huge boulders deposited where houses used to be. These homes and the area immediately surrounding them at Black Hollow, as the settlement is known, had been spared in the 2020 Cameron Peak Fire (CPF). But it became a place of destruction and tragedy more than six months after the fire had been declared contained due to a massive debris flow, a phenomenon closely linked to wildfire as an ecological disturbance.</p>
<p>Wildfire can change the hydrological conditions of a watershed in ways that make it more susceptible to flooding or debris flows, in what is known as a cascading hazard <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hydeUncertaintiesPredictingDebris2016"><strong>hydeUncertaintiesPredictingDebris2016?</strong></a>)</span>. Based on my research in a community affected by the CPF, I show how cascading hazards have cascading consequences for people’s lives and social structures writ large. I argue that drawing on existing ecological frameworks of the wildfire-flood disturbance cascade to interrogate the wildfire-social disturbance cascade enables the possibility of responding to wildfire in a way that explicitly links social-ecological systems. I propose that cross-disciplinary teams examine post-fire social-ecological conditions and conduct assessments over longer timescales to help coordinate long-term recovery efforts in response to cascading social and ecological consequences.</p>
<p>In geology, cascading hazards refer to a sequencing of processes, beginning with a primary hazard which precipitates the formation of additional hazards <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sharmaIncreasingRiskCascading2023"><strong>sharmaIncreasingRiskCascading2023?</strong></a>)</span>. This is also sometimes called a disturbance cascade <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nakamuraDisturbanceRegimesStream2000"><strong>nakamuraDisturbanceRegimesStream2000?</strong></a>)</span>. One example of an ecological disturbance with additional hazard potential, and the one germane to the subject of this paper, is a wildfire which leads to post-wildfire flooding and debris flows. In 2020, a year of record-breaking wildfire activity across the western United States <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022"><strong>rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022?</strong></a>)</span>, the CPF funneled through the upper Poudre Canyon in northern Colorado on two days of extreme fire spread. This was followed by extensive flooding and debris flows in the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023, including at Black Hollow.</p>
<p>The physical damage wrought by these intersecting disasters is well documented, and has been quantified in the number of structures destroyed, acres burned, or occurrence of debris flows. The CPF is Colorado’s largest wildfire in state history encompassing 208,912 acres <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-WFIGSInteragencyFire2023"><strong>WFIGSInteragencyFire2023?</strong></a>)</span>, which destroyed 492 structures across sixteen communities and three watersheds, including the Poudre, Big Thompson, and Laramie watersheds <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coalitionforthepoudreriverwatershedCameronPeakFire"><strong>coalitionforthepoudreriverwatershedCameronPeakFire?</strong></a>)</span>. These kinds of statistics appear in research papers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022"><strong>rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022?</strong></a>)</span>, on state <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-HistoricalWildfireInformation2024"><strong>HistoricalWildfireInformation2024?</strong></a>)</span> and nonprofit websites <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coalitionforthepoudreriverwatershedCameronPeakFire"><strong>coalitionforthepoudreriverwatershedCameronPeakFire?</strong></a>)</span>, and in newspaper stories <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-larsenCameronPeakFire2020"><strong>larsenCameronPeakFire2020?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-DeadlyFlashFlood2021"><strong>DeadlyFlashFlood2021?</strong></a>)</span>. As such, numbers become the main way impacts from these hazards are narrated and understood by both the public and government officials. These quantifiable categorizations are typical of most disasters, characterizing them as ‘temporary aberrations from normal conditions’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fiskeSlowOnsetDisasterClimate2019"><strong>fiskeSlowOnsetDisasterClimate2019?</strong></a>)</span>, the idea of which shapes frameworks of disaster response procedures in the U.S. Information about emergency response and recovery is similarly quantitatively understood and measured by, for example, acres burned at high severity, inventories of fish species at risk in burned areas <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fairchildFinalFisheriesSpecialist2020"><strong>fairchildFinalFisheriesSpecialist2020?</strong></a>)</span>, or roads most vulnerable to flooding impacts <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-larimercountyofficeofemergencymanagementCameronPeakFire2021"><strong>larimercountyofficeofemergencymanagementCameronPeakFire2021?</strong></a>)</span>. These statistics provide critical information which can be measured against other wildfires and flooding events and offer a sense of both the scale and the number of people or communities who were or are exposed to risk.</p>
<p>Relying primarily on quantitative assessments, however, obscures the varied experiences of contending with multiple hazards, as well as the ongoing ways people’s lives continue to be affected, cascading out from the wildfire, for years to come. Quantitative summaries of disaster can also be mobilized by those actors involved in governance who are fluent in the language of risk analysis to produce quantitative risk assessments which not only overshadow non-quantifiable discourses of uncertainty but also hold a strategic advantage in decision-making processes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-grovesBombMyBackyard2015"><strong>grovesBombMyBackyard2015?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Disaster anthropologists have shown that disaster survivors are uniquely positioned to reflect on the affective experience of the social and material consequences of disasters <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosGoverningAffectNeoliberalism2017">Barrios 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-oliver-smithTheorizingVulnerabilityGlobalized2004"><strong>oliver-smithTheorizingVulnerabilityGlobalized2004?</strong></a>)</span>, and the same is true for those who have experienced wildfire and its associated hazards. The complex, sometimes unanticipated, lived experiences of wildfire are important to uncover and interrogate as a way to help better prepare individuals, governments, and society to plan for, respond to, and recover from a series of disasters propagating out beyond the start and end dates of the wildfire itself.</p>
<p>I suggest that in the context of the CPF, and arguably, in the context of most wildfires, there are ongoing and complex consequences for people’s lives which cannot be easily enumerated and are therefore not as visible to nor considered by the public, policymakers, and fire and emergency managers. How do we account for, acknowledge, and respond to the complex circumstances of people’s lives which result from living through a wildfire? What does recovery look like when we consider the breadth of experiences and account for longer time horizons in our response mechanisms? Focusing on narratives and perspectives emerging from ethnographic fieldwork in the Poudre Canyon, I harness the concept of cascading hazards to examine the accompanying cascading consequences affecting people in this mountainous area of northern Colorado following the CPF.</p>
<p>This article is organized as follows. First, I propose a conceptual framework of the social-ecological disturbance cascade for responding to wildfires. Second, I provide an overview of the literature on wildfire and disturbance in the social sciences and the anthropological approaches I draw on for this paper. Third, I describe my study site and the specific landscape characteristics which support a social-ecological perspective of disturbance. Fourth, I explain the methods I used for my research and why they are relevant for a landscape perspective of wildfire-related disturbance examining human and more than human relations. Fifth, I present and discuss results showing how cascading hazards resulting from wildfires have cascading consequences for people’s lives. Finally, I reflect on the fire and emergency management and policy implications for utilizing a social-ecological disturbance cascade framework and propose one possible strategy for wildfire recovery in the future.</p>

<p>Following the CPF and other large-scale wildfires, researchers have been studying changes to soil microbiome diversity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nelsonWildfiredependentChangesSoil2022"><strong>nelsonWildfiredependentChangesSoil2022?</strong></a>)</span>, the relationship between wildfire-induced changes in source water to downstream water supply and agricultural production <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barnardWildfireClimateChange2023"><strong>barnardWildfireClimateChange2023?</strong></a>)</span>, the role of large woody debris in post-fire debris flow sediment retention <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rengersInfluenceLargeWoody2023"><strong>rengersInfluenceLargeWoody2023?</strong></a>)</span>, analysis of post-fire conditions to guide reforestation management <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022"><strong>rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022?</strong></a>)</span>, and how spatial heterogeneity in post-fire mountain watersheds influences the transport of sediment downstream <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wohlBiogeomorphicInfluencesRiver2022"><strong>wohlBiogeomorphicInfluencesRiver2022?</strong></a>)</span>, among many other projects.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the social sciences, I am aware of only one research project related to community member experiences following CPF <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kooistraWebinarResidentsPerspectives2022"><strong>kooistraWebinarResidentsPerspectives2022?</strong></a>)</span> and one project assessing risk management tools during the fire <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-caggianoCameronPeakFire2021"><strong>caggianoCameronPeakFire2021?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There is no commonly used term to describe cascading hazards in the social sciences, even though there is a strong history of social science research on the human dimensions of wildfires, including the recognition of wildfire as having both ecological and social ramifications <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tomanSocialScienceWildlandurban2013"><strong>tomanSocialScienceWildlandurban2013?</strong></a>)</span>. I propose the term social-ecological disturbance cascade to delineate the explicit relationship between a wildfire, its ecological disturbance cascade, and the cascading consequences for people’s lives it sets in motion. My research demonstrates that communities who suffer ongoing impacts from wildfires often experience them in ways connected to the ecological disturbance cascade and could benefit from an approach that mirrors some watershed-specific, longitudinal studies more common in ecological and geological research and restoration of post-wildfire conditions. Acknowledgement and understanding of social-ecological linkages in disturbances among those in positions of power, who formulate policy, and researchers of all backgrounds conducting wildfire and post-wildfire studies which inform policy and management decisions would stimulate and support more comprehensive future wildfire response and recovery efforts that are sensitive to the complex and ongoing needs of people living in wildfire-impacted areas.</p>
<p>Linking the study of ecological and social disturbance cascades facilitates an understanding of wildfire as a phenomenon shaped by and with implications for both ecological and social forces and enables the possibility of inclusive social-ecological responsiveness. Currently, at the federal level, preparation for and response to wildfire is logistically, financially, and administratively separated from preparations and responses associated with flooding caused by wildfires, and from wildfire smoke. Responsibility for these different phenomena is spread across multiple agencies operating under different mandates and with no clear pathway for cross-agency coordination. Wildfire management, including its prevention or reduction in its severity, is primarily the purview of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). Wildfire smoke, on the other hand, which inevitably accompanies wildfires but can also be experienced by communities far from the source of the wildfire — such as the smoke engulfing New York City from Canadian wildfires in 2023 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lowreyNewYorkFailed2023"><strong>lowreyNewYorkFailed2023?</strong></a>)</span> — is managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Research on post-fire flooding and debris flows is published by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), while funding for private property flood mitigation is often routed through the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), unless it is funded and directed instead under the purview of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the event of federally declared disasters. States, counties, municipalities, fire districts, and nonprofits all interface with federal agencies in managing wildfire and post-fire watersheds in different ways.</p>
<p>This multi-jurisdictional but disunited management approach to the multiple hazards associated with wildfire and their implications for human lives results in disjointed preparedness. Readying the space surrounding one’s home in order for the house to better withstand a wildfire does not prepare a homeowner to prevent excessive exposure to wildfire smoke. Similarly, post-fire recovery is multifaceted and jurisdictionally complex. Homeowners may be faced with a number of different challenges, including life-threatening flooding, road and bridge access or damage issues, insurance claims, home rebuilding and permitting processes, hazardous trees, slash (woody debris) build-up, emotional and physical distress, infestations of invasive plant and insect species, property damage from bears, rodents, or decomposing food during evacuations and power shut-offs, and reforestation needs. Any one of these issues may be managed alternately by different federal, state, or county agencies or nonprofits or not managed by any jurisdiction at all. There may be resources and funding available for a short period to address certain challenges such as the sandbags provided by the Larimer County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) the first summer following the CPF in 2021 but not for subsequent flooding events in the summers of 2022 and 2023. These challenges may occur simultaneously or years apart from each other, highlighting the need for a pathway to recovery built in response to anticipated and unanticipated, or simply cascading, social-ecological disturbances over multiple timescales and jurisdictions. A pathway which includes funding mechanisms to address wildfire-related preparation, response, and recovery over a longer timeframe, accounts for cross-jurisdictional complexity, and provides a central hub of resources and support would reduce the navigational hurdles with which those confronting multiple hazards over a number of years have to contend.</p>

Among social scientists studying wildfire, there is broad recognition that wildfires have wide-ranging social impacts beyond that which can be captured by statistics. Compared to other disasters such as hurricanes or floods, research on the ways wildfires impact specific communities over time is less common, and ecological consequences may be easier to characterize than social ones <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kentSocialEconomicIssues2003"><strong>kentSocialEconomicIssues2003?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The concept of disturbance has also previously been leveraged to characterize wildfire impacts on people’s lives.

<div id="anthropological-approaches-to-disaster-landscape-and-time" class="section level4" number="2.3.0.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.0.1</span> Anthropological Approaches to Disaster, Landscape, and Time</h4>
<p>In spite of multidecadal research related to wildfire across disciplinary fields in the social sciences that has come to inform fire and emergency management strategies, the way we understand, prepare for, and respond to wildfires more generally continues to artificially separate social and ecological disturbances and their consequences over different timescales and across multiple jurisdictions. Anthropological scholarship identifies the temporal inscriptions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-adamsMarketsSorrowLabors2013">Adams 2013</a>)</span> and social lives of disasters <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sorensenSocialLifeDisasters2015"><strong>sorensenSocialLifeDisasters2015?</strong></a>)</span>, which, through various cultural processes, expand beyond the timeframe and physical perimeter of the disaster itself.</p>
<p>Anthropologists have encouraged the consideration of materialist conceptualizations of time and space <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mooreAnthropoceneAnthropologyReconceptualizing2016"><strong>mooreAnthropoceneAnthropologyReconceptualizing2016?</strong></a>)</span>, particularly in relation to the Anthropocene, the term proposed to signify a new geological epoch characterized by human-driven actions and processes. Whatever criticisms there may be of the term Anthropocene <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-millingtonHimalayanBuddhismHuman2024"><strong>millingtonHimalayanBuddhismHuman2024?</strong></a>)</span>, attending to the way human materialities and temporalities intersect with more than human material and temporal formations and processes requires us to conceptualize ‘an expansive ecology of time’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-widgerMonsoonUncertaintiesHydrochemical2020"><strong>widgerMonsoonUncertaintiesHydrochemical2020?</strong></a>)</span> which transcends a human-centered idea of history <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chakrabartyAnthropoceneTime2018"><strong>chakrabartyAnthropoceneTime2018?</strong></a>)</span> and the ‘complex conjunctures’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mooreAnthropoceneAnthropologyReconceptualizing2016"><strong>mooreAnthropoceneAnthropologyReconceptualizing2016?</strong></a>)</span> of the spaces of the Anthropocene. Following Tsing and coauthors, who propose that anthropologists engage with landscape to study how human and beyond human relations are structured relative to each other <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingPatchyAnthropoceneLandscape2019">A. L. Tsing, Mathews, and Bubandt 2019</a>)</span>, I use the post-wildfire landscape of the Poudre Canyon to understand the conditions of social and ecological disturbances resulting from the CPF and reverberating over time in response to each other. Situated ethnographic fieldwork over longer time horizons more typical in anthropology can illuminate narrative experiences of wildfire and its cascading consequences over time and help make sense of the ways in which these experiences are often connected to or exacerbated by the ecological disturbance cascade.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="study-site" class="section level2" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Study site</h2>
<p>As I describe in this section, the Poudre Canyon constitutes a landscape conducive to cascading geological hazards resulting from wildfire. There are 750 full-time and 1,500 part-time residents <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Us2024"><strong>Us2024?</strong></a>)</span>. The Poudre River parallels Highway 14 in the canyon for approximately forty miles as it flows along the contours of steep, forested slopes and rocky outcrops, supplying water for the hundreds of thousands of people in the populous Front Range cities of Fort Collins and Greeley. The Poudre Canyon’s two main population centers are divided between the lower and upper canyon. In 2012, the High Park Fire swept through the lower Poudre and several nearby communities, destroying 259 homes. In 2020, the CPF burned over much of the upper Poudre and fifteen other communities in Colorado over nearly four months. My own family’s historic home, and that of our neighbor’s, located in the upper Poudre, were the first two houses to burn in the fire, an experience which initiated this research inquiry.</p>
<p>The river corridor itself is made up of 85% federal lands, with only 2,000 out of 25,000 acres in private ownership <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-CachePoudreWild1990"><strong>CachePoudreWild1990?</strong></a>)</span>. The lands beyond the corridor are primarily owned by the USFS. Private lands are primarily situated along the river where flatter ground makes it easier to build, hemmed in by the canyon’s steep, rocky mountainsides, carved out by a glacier in the uppermost sections of the canyon, or by the river, below the glacier’s end moraine. Many, if not all, of these flatter pieces of land were formed either by alluvial fans, an accumulation of sediments that fans outward at the point where a steeper gradient meets a less steep gradient, or because they are part of the river’s old floodplain. The Poudre River watershed drains around 1,889 square miles in the canyon alone, although the river continues east as it flows out of the canyon, 125 miles in total until its confluence with the South Platte River on the eastern plains of Colorado. In populated areas of the Poudre, some of the river’s thousands of miles of tributaries pass through private lands, often in their lowest reaches before reaching the river. Most early settlers, and where the largest numbers of people continue to be based, built in proximity to a creek and prioritized settling land where they could ranch, mine, or extract timber, which was sent down the river during the years 1868 to 1885 to use as railroad ties <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-evansCachePoudreNatural1991"><strong>evansCachePoudreNatural1991?</strong></a>)</span>. This topography, formed by thousands of years of geologic movement, combined with land use and ownership established over shorter timescales, help shape the nature of the consequences which people in the Poudre experienced over the course of two large wildfires and in the years following these wildfires.</p>
<p>The Poudre is officially composed of three unincorporated communities <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-LarimerCountyColorado2024"><strong>LarimerCountyColorado2024?</strong></a>)</span>. Larimer County, and its Board of County Commissioners with three elected officials, is the defacto governing body for all unincorporated communities, although the Poudre Canyon Fire Protection District (PCFPD) is a local governmental entity whose jurisdiction for emergency response and wildfire management encompasses the entire populated length of the Poudre Canyon <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Us2024"><strong>Us2024?</strong></a>)</span>. Post-CPF recovery coordination was divided geographically in the Poudre Canyon between the City of Greeley, which has water rights to the Poudre River, and Larimer County. City of Greeley coordinated watershed recovery west, or upstream, of a bridge called Crown Point, and Larimer County was responsible for the areas east of this, or downstream.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level2" number="2.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Methods</h2>
<p>I used ethnographic research methods to investigate how cascading hazards resulting from the CPF have cascading consequences for those affected by the wildfire. Ethnography is able to capture the situated, temporal complexities of how humans are affected by wildfires and associated hazards <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mcgranahanWhatEthnographyTeaching2015"><strong>mcgranahanWhatEthnographyTeaching2015?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-jusionyteThresholdEmergencyResponders2018"><strong>jusionyteThresholdEmergencyResponders2018?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="participant-observation" class="section level3" number="2.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> Participant Observation</h3>
<p>From June 2022 to October 2023, I lived in the upper Poudre and participated in activities such as social events, community association and fire board meetings, and site visits to private property and USFS lands impacted by wildfire or flooding. I joined the PCFPD as a volunteer and learned about how the fire district operates in relation to other agencies, such as the USFS and Larimer County Emergency Services. I attended conferences on wildland fire and natural hazards, joined educational tours and citizen science initiatives coordinated by local nonprofits, and participated in chipping and burning slash for neighbors.</p>
</div>
<div id="interviews" class="section level3" number="2.5.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.2</span> Interviews</h3>
<p>I conducted fifty semi-structured interviews with community members, wildland fire, emergency and watershed management practitioners, and researchers whose studies intersect with ecological, geological, or social aspects of wildfire, post-fire flooding, or recovery. Of these, twelve also included open-ended conversations while walking in the CPF burn scar or accompanying researchers doing scientific fieldwork, a kind of walking interview <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-evansWalkingInterviewMethodology2011"><strong>evansWalkingInterviewMethodology2011?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-carpianoComeTakeWalk2009"><strong>carpianoComeTakeWalk2009?</strong></a>)</span>. In addition to interviews, I also used the go-along method <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kusenbachStreetPhenomenologyGoAlong2003"><strong>kusenbachStreetPhenomenologyGoAlong2003?</strong></a>)</span> to accompany three different teams of researchers — fluvial geomorphologists, biogeochemists, and geologists — in four wildfire-impacted watersheds during their fieldwork, and seven scientists and fire/watershed managers within areas of the CPF burn perimeter. I identified participants by meeting them at community events, conferences, and other events, through literature reviews, and snowball sampling.</p>
<p>My premise, reflected in the experiences of those I interviewed and the conditions I observed, is that wildfire initiates a series of ongoing, cascading impacts on people’s lives, captured through sustained research presence and engagement with community and expressed through narratives.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="categories-of-consequences" class="section level2" number="2.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Categories of Consequences</h2>
<p>In this section, I examine the different social consequences emerging from the 2020 CPF in the upper Poudre Canyon, showing that 1) social impacts on people’s lives can be categorized to capture the broad range of cascading experiences resulting from the original disturbance of the wildfire; 2) while social and ecological disturbances can occur in a kind of feedback loop, tracing ecological disturbances can help us anticipate social ones; and 3) the social-ecological disturbance cascade will be different for each community affected by wildfire but can be used to inform future scenarios for communities which have not yet experienced wildfire.</p>
<p>According to the measures typically used to account for how destructive a wildfire is, the upper Poudre fared reasonably well. Of the 492 structures destroyed in CPF, which lasted for 112 days, fewer than twenty were in the upper Poudre, which was the closest community to the wildfire and experienced two days of rapid fire growth over a month apart, affecting different sides of the canyon. Of the structures lost in the Poudre, none were primary homes, nobody died in the wildfire, including firefighters, even though it occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which complicated firefighting efforts and evacuations. These numbers, while important, do not contain within them the many ways people’s lives were disrupted by the wildfire that are essential for thinking through how to help other communities in the future respond to and recover from wildfire. Below, I provide some examples of social disturbance cascades, many of them linked to disturbances on the landscape.</p>
<div id="during-the-fire" class="section level3" number="2.6.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.1</span> During the Fire</h3>
<p>One couple in the upper Poudre was evacuated from their home the day the fire started just after stocking their refrigerator with groceries from Fort Collins. They were only able to return to their property seventy-three days later, after living in a hotel room with two cats. By the time they were permitted to return home, they had to replace their kitchen floor and their refrigerator on account of the food which had melted and rotted onto the floor when the power was shut off. One of their neighbors fared worse because his home was broken into multiple times by a bear who smelled the decomposing food and wreaked havoc throughout the house. The damage was so extensive he had to hire a contractor, who turned out to be corrupt. When I interviewed the neighbor about his experiences, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, in a lot of ways, the fire was the end at the same time that the fire was the beginning. It’s tough when I think about it and I get emotional still, I get very upset. What I grew up with and what was inculcated into my being about the woods and the wilderness and the animals and the views and a sense of belonging to all that. The fire ended that. And while I’m appreciative of the little oasis, I’m still devastated when I drive through the burn scar. So the fire was the end. But then the fire is also the beginning, like the forest floor coming back and wildlife returning. But it also was the beginning, the catalyst for all these subsequent events. The bear wouldn’t have been in here if the fire hadn’t burned through, and he wasn’t distressed and hungry. If I hadn’t evacuated and stuffed everything in the freezer thinking I’m gonna be back in a few days. And then the power gets shut off, and all of a sudden the cabin reeks, and he has a smorgasbord for four days. Never would have happened. If that hadn’t happened, I never would have had to hire this jackass of a contractor. And he wouldn’t have destroyed my house and done more damage than the bear did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the presence of wildlife is often awe-inspiring for Poudre Canyon residents and one of the reasons people enjoy living there. During and in the years since the wildfire, however, residents have encountered some animals in unusual ways: multiple break-ins from bears, sometimes at strange times, like the night of the Black Hollow debris flow in one of the surviving homes; extreme mice infestations in a home evacuated for a short time; packrats which had previously nested in a workshop which burned down moved into the house which survived; and a black widow infestation where none of these spiders had been seen before over multiple generations. Some of these impacts are short-lived, like the mice infestation, whereas others are persistent, like the packrat nests. These multispecies encounters <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ogdenAnimalsPlantsPeople2013"><strong>ogdenAnimalsPlantsPeople2013?</strong></a>)</span>, in their myriad forms, are one of the unaccounted-for categories of the consequences of wildfire.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that when it comes to people’s interactions with wildlife following the wildfire, not all have been negative. In the summer of 2023, an ecologist pointed out mating Lewis’s Woodpeckers on my family’s land in an area she said they would not have found habitat before the fire. Two people interviewed in 2023 observed that wildlife seems to be thriving after the wildfire based on their observations, more twin moose calves and fawns and more abundant and diverse wildlife sightings in general. This may point to another kind of opening when we connect social and ecological circumstances in examining wildfire’s impacts. People’s experiences and perceptions of ecological conditions in the Poudre help shape how they make sense of wildfire, of a changed and changing landscape, of the beginnings and ends of things and how they feel about them.</p>
</div>
<div id="after-the-fire" class="section level3" number="2.6.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.6.2</span> After the Fire</h3>
<p>For the people who did lose homes or other buildings to the wildfire, it set in motion its own series of cascading impacts, which are specific to this experience, in the form of loss of sense of place <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020"><strong>schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-maldonadoCooccurringAccumulatingDisasters2018"><strong>maldonadoCooccurringAccumulatingDisasters2018?</strong></a>)</span>, complicated insurance claims, regulations which did not exist when the original constructions were built, obstructions from the county permitting office, being underinsured and therefore unable to afford to rebuild, lack of reliable access to the homesite due to ongoing flooding or erosion issues, or inability to rebuild in the same location for similar reasons, all of which were realities for people who lost homes in the Poudre. One couple I interviewed who rebuilt their house themselves said they were assigned eight different insurance claims agents in a process they described as ‘belittling.’ Another family still has not been able to rebuild as of the summer of 2024 because parts of the road to their land are continually being eroded or obstructed from flooding off the steep channels on an adjacent mountainside.</p>
<p>Six more families lost their homes in the Black Hollow debris flow, and four people their lives, a tragic illustration of how the wildfire (that caused no immediate loss of life) then initiated an ecological disturbance cascade with devastating repercussions for the people whose lives intersected with it. We can trace other repercussions by following the flow of water. The centeredness of the river in this physical and cultural landscape draws our attention to particular human and other than human material relations and conveyances of risk, where the river reflects “the cumulative historical effects” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wohlVirtualRiversLessons2001"><strong>wohlVirtualRiversLessons2001?</strong></a>)</span> of everything in its basin. Many people must cross bridges over the river to get to their homes. Where historically the river was the central focus of mining and was used to transport logs for railroad ties, now it is what draws hundreds of thousands to the canyon each year for recreation. And in the first summer after the wildfire, it collected bodies, homes, logs, boulders, and sediment in a debris flow event, choking out fish, undermining two bridges, and affecting water supply storage systems in two downstream major population centers dozens of miles away.</p>
<p>Most people in the Poudre Canyon get their drinking water from wells. It is the hundreds of thousands of people living in the northern Colorado cities of Fort Collins and Greeley — and the municipal water managers for these cities — who have to contend with the water quality impacts to the Poudre River due to sediment transport from all the tributaries. The recently retired water manager for the City of Greeley told me in June 2023 that the city had to shut off their Poudre River water intake valves for forty days after the 2012 High Park Fire, at least a month the first summer after the CPF, and at least four times since then. Social and ecological disturbance cascades are not limited to the burn perimeter of the wildfire, and different geographies are subject to particular hazards over different timescales.</p>
<p>While residents in populous Front Range cities who rely on the Poudre River for drinking water are put at risk by the downstream effects of wildfire over time, those who live in the upper Poudre have been subject to what one geomorphologist responsible for designing much of the post-fire flood mitigation in the Poudre Canyon referred to as ‘nuisance flooding.’ I doubt this is how most people affected by flooding in the Poudre would characterize it, but the term is meant to indicate flooding which is not catastrophic, in contrast to the Black Hollow debris flow, for example. These smaller flooding events can still be scary and dangerous. Six inches of fast moving water can knock over an adult <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-usdepartmentofcommerceTurnDonDrown"><strong>usdepartmentofcommerceTurnDonDrown?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Flooding in the Poudre over the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023 impacted some of the same people again and again. One person’s basement was inundated with flood waters after the force of the water broke the window, and while the mitigation work that was done helped prevent water from entering the house again, their driveway was damaged by another flooding event more than a year later. I myself was unable to leave the place I was living on several occasions over two summers until a neighbor with heavy equipment came and moved all the rock out of the way which had accumulated on my access road from flooding events. Another couple shoveled sludge deposited by flood water out of their driveway and that of their neighbor’s at least twice. It was like shoveling cement, they said. Neighborhood and county roads in several places in the upper Poudre had to be repaired several times after being eroded by repeat flooding. As I write this at the end of May 2024, I received the first flash flood warning of the year for the CPF burn scar, unusually early and an indication that in the fourth summer after the fire, flooding danger continues to pose a hazard to lives, infrastructure, and watersheds. This signifies that both social and ecological disturbances persist, that as long as the watersheds in the Poudre Canyon continue to be affected by a disturbance cascade, so will its people.</p>

<p>As part of understanding, and anticipating, the complex ways ecological and social disturbances exist in relation to each other following a wildfire, and in order to better assist in community recovery, we need more creative strategies. We need strategies which center people within the context of disturbance cascades linked to wildfire as much as watersheds, or rather which consider people as part of an integrated set of human and other human relations. In an assessment of the social and economic impacts from the 2002 Hayman Fire, which held the status of Colorado’s largest wildfire for eighteen years, a suggestion emerged from a series of post-fire interviews for the existence of a ‘national, interagency, rehabilitation coordinator’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kentSocialEconomicIssues2003"><strong>kentSocialEconomicIssues2003?</strong></a>)</span> to facilitate communication with the public and between agencies like the USFS and the NRCS to coordinate recovery efforts on private and public lands. Twenty-two years after the Hayman Fire, nothing like this has materialized.</p>
<p>I propose a modification of an ecological assessment following wildfires on USFS lands that could provide a helpful template for considering social-ecological disturbances over time. A team of specialists from the USFS across multiple resource areas, such as soil and watershed scientists, fire and forest ecologists, botanists, and archeologists, conduct what is called a Burned Area Emergency Assessment (BAER) following larger or more severe wildfires. The first assessment is done as soon as possible after or during a wildfire, in areas it has already passed through. The team uses a combination of rapid assessment tools, models, and professional judgement to assess threats to critical values on USFS lands as a result of the wildfire and determine a set of treatment options.</p>
<p>A soil scientist and BAER Program Coordinator with the USFS in Colorado explained to me that these ‘critical values on forest system lands are obviously just a subset of all values and concerns in the post-wildfire environment.’ Because some information collected by the BAER team is at a watershed scale, however, even though it is only conducted on USFS lands, it is collected in coordination with and can be utilized by county level emergency managers, municipal water providers, the state transportation department, and the USGS, among others. By way of example, the USGS makes a map and spatial data available to the public of preliminary debris flow hazard assessments at the drainage-basin scale using some information produced by the BAER team, such as field-validated soil burn severity data. This is some of the earliest and most accessible publicly available data to help private landowners determine their level of exposure to flooding or debris flows. My own family relied on the assessment published by the USGS in 2020 for the CPF to determine that it was unsafe to rebuild in the same location. Sometimes the BAER assessments occur over phases, although they are designed to be done as soon as possible after a wildfire.</p>
<p>I propose that, perhaps under the purview of a national, interagency rehabilitation coordinator, we draw on those aspects of BAER which might be relevant for assessing the combined social-ecological impacts following a wildfire. Rather than a team of specialists solely from the USFS and with expertise only in ecology, geology, fire, and archeology, each wildfire could be assigned a cross-jurisdictional team representing broader interests and land ownership, including quantitative and qualitative social scientists and a representative from the local fire district. The team’s explicit mission could be to gather information on and analyze social-ecological disturbances as part of a connected system, with the responsibility of conducting phased assessments and recommending recovery strategies over a timescale which accounts for the social-ecological disturbance cascade over a number of years. The existence of such a team would help remove artificial boundaries which currently exist between wildfire and post-fire watershed management and between these ecological phenomena and the impacts they have on people’s lives. Such a team would provide continuity, and accountability, to people and jurisdictions affected by wildfires during a bewildering and difficult time. Support for such an initiative would require federal funding and possibly the creation of new legislation. To this end, there is recognition of the difficulty of managing wildfire at the federal level by the USFS in the recently published Wildfire Crisis Strategy <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-forestserviceConfrontingWildfireCrisis2022">Service 2022</a>)</span> and by legislators in the form of funding allocated toward addressing wildfire challenges through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Given this and the extraordinary wildfire and climate change challenges communities and governments are facing across the world, it would benefit us all to pursue innovative strategies for living with, and recovering from, wildfire.</p>
<p>In this paper, I suggest that mobilizing the concept of a disturbance cascade which links social and ecological systems disrupted by wildfire expands our capacity for evaluating the social impacts of wildfire as a social-ecological disturbance cascade, both immediately following wildfires and over time. Ecological disturbance theory recognizes the complexity of how ecosystems respond to disturbances over different timescales <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gaiserLongTermEcologicalResearch2020"><strong>gaiserLongTermEcologicalResearch2020?</strong></a>)</span>. In the American West, flooding and debris flows are a known element in the wildfire disturbance cascade and an active area of scholarly inquiry <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-burnettFactorsInfluencingFlood2023"><strong>burnettFactorsInfluencingFlood2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-liuGuidanceParameterizingPostfire2023"><strong>liuGuidanceParameterizingPostfire2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-graberHowLongRunoffGenerated2023"><strong>graberHowLongRunoffGenerated2023?</strong></a>)</span>. Conceptualizing wildfire as dual disturbance cascades — both social and ecological — could facilitate research that examines the implications of flooding and debris flows following wildfire in a more systematic way. In turn, this would support awareness among emergency and land managers and legislators, the formation of policies which explicitly address post-fire flooding, and funding mechanisms which account for cascading hazards.</p>

<p>“Living with fire.” “Live Wildfire Ready.” “Fire Adapted Communities.” These are some of the common catchphrases that presently dominate messaging about wildfire to the American public <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brenkert-smithLivingWildfirePark2023"><strong>brenkert-smithLivingWildfirePark2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-LiveWildfireReady"><strong>LiveWildfireReady?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-tomanSocialScienceWildlandurban2013"><strong>tomanSocialScienceWildlandurban2013?</strong></a>)</span>. Most people in the U.S. will be familiar with the persistent mascot of the United States Forest Service (USFS), Smokey Bear, and his message, “Only You Can Prevent Wildfires”. These phrases reflect dominant narratives in the wildland fire practitioner and management community and signify how the public, and particularly those people who live in fire adapted landscapes, are supposed to understand and navigate their relationship with wildfire. What does living with fire mean, to the agencies promoting these ideas, and to the communities toward whom this messaging is directed? What does it look like to facilitate living in a world where the impacts from wildfires affect people and places across jurisdictions for many years after the wildfire itself?</p>
<p>In this paper, I address these questions in the context of a rural community in northern Colorado called the Poudre Canyon, which was one of sixteen communities impacted by the 2020 Cameron Peak Fire (CPF), the largest in Colorado state history. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted over more than two years, I argue that we need to broaden our conceptualization of what it means to live with wildfire to include hazards which often accompany it, such as wildfire smoke, flooding, and debris flows. This would help communities better prepare for the multiple hazards associated with wildfire, and also assist policymakers and governments to identify infrastructure gaps for integrated response. Attending to multiple hazards represented by wildfire also expands our understanding of the geographies of risk, facilitating a shift in focus to include not only communities who live in fire adapted landscapes but also those potentially impacted by smoke and the downstream effects of wildfire-impacted watersheds. Wildfire — and the smoke, heat, and floods which accompany it — affects everyone, not just those who live in landscapes that burn. Harnessing the language of living with fire,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> I propose moving beyond current framing of “personal responsibility” and instead understanding people who live in fire adapted landscapes as potential stewards rather than agents of increased risk. Recognizing that the concept of stewardship is contested and how it is operationalized can allocate authority to some and not others <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-walkerWhoseLandscapePolitical2003"><strong>walkerWhoseLandscapePolitical2003?</strong></a>)</span>, I follow conceptualizations that define stewardship as a process <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-conradHumanSocialDimensions2017"><strong>conradHumanSocialDimensions2017?</strong></a>)</span> that is relational <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kimmererBraidingSweetgrassIndigenous2013"><strong>kimmererBraidingSweetgrassIndigenous2013?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-hellerIncludingStewardshipEcosystem2023"><strong>hellerIncludingStewardshipEcosystem2023?</strong></a>)</span> and centers care for both the human and more than human world, and agency for communities living in fire adapted landscapes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pecanhaenqvistStewardshipBoundaryObject2018"><strong>pecanhaenqvistStewardshipBoundaryObject2018?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>I challenge the utility of the term wildland urban interface (WUI) to delineate geographies of wildfire risk because it creates homogenizing assumptions about communities in the WUI which hinders effective wildfire risk communication and reduction. I show how many people in the Poudre have a broad understanding of the multiple risks involved in living in a mountain environment, of which wildfire risk is but one consideration. Living with fire is a process, and I argue those who study, reside, and work in fire adapted landscapes, are undergoing a period of recalibration in response to more extreme wildfires and their associated hazards.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Narratives Around Wildfire Risk</h2>
<p>The policy focus on living with or adapting to fire is easy to understand. In many areas around the world, including the U.S., Canada, Mediterranean Europe, and Australia, wildfires are increasing in size, frequency, and severity due to a combination of climate change, forest management, and land use factors <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coopExtremeFireSpread2022"><strong>coopExtremeFireSpread2022?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-wassermanClimateInfluencesFuture2023"><strong>wassermanClimateInfluencesFuture2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-turnerMagnitudeDirectionTempo2022"><strong>turnerMagnitudeDirectionTempo2022?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-mathewsWildfiresGhostsPathogen2021"><strong>mathewsWildfiresGhostsPathogen2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-parksContemporaryWildfiresAre2023"><strong>parksContemporaryWildfiresAre2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-castellnouEmpoweringStrategicDecisionmaking2019"><strong>castellnouEmpoweringStrategicDecisionmaking2019?</strong></a>)</span>. At the federal level in the U.S., this reality is characterized as a wildfire crisis in several publications <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-forestserviceConfrontingWildfireCrisis2022">Service 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-WildfireCrisisLandscape2022"><strong>WildfireCrisisLandscape2022?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-swainEraMegafiresCrisis2018"><strong>swainEraMegafiresCrisis2018?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-BidenHarrisAdministrationLaunches2023"><strong>BidenHarrisAdministrationLaunches2023?</strong></a>)</span> whose narratives reflect a broad understanding that more destructive wildfires interfacing with our built environments are inevitable, so communities and society need to prepare to experience wildfire.</p>
<p>In the U.S. these narratives are delineated by certain phrases, such as “defensible space,” the “Home Ignition Zone (HIZ)”, or “personal responsibility” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coloradostateforestserviceHomeIgnitionZone2021"><strong>coloradostateforestserviceHomeIgnitionZone2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-coloradostateforestserviceProtectYourHome"><strong>coloradostateforestserviceProtectYourHome?</strong></a>)</span>, all directed at preparing individual homeowners who live in the WUI, to perform wildfire risk reduction efforts around their properties. The WUI is defined by the Colorado State Forest Service (CSFS) as an “area where structures or other human developments meet or intermingle with wildland vegetation or fuels” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-LarimerCountyWildfire"><strong>LarimerCountyWildfire?</strong></a>)</span>. Research has shown removing vegetation in the vicinity of homes and altering houses to make them more resistant to fire can be effective at reducing wildfire risk <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cohenWildlandurbanInterfaceFire2008"><strong>cohenWildlandurbanInterfaceFire2008?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-maranghidesWUIStructureParcel2022"><strong>maranghidesWUIStructureParcel2022?</strong></a>)</span>. Focusing on wildfire mitigation around homes is therefore a sensible strategy by the fire management community to promote risk reduction. However, the ways in which guidance regarding mitigation is communicated to homeowners and the general public is premised on a number of assumptions, which I suggest are ultimately harmful to the strategic goals of reducing wildfire risk in communities.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Reexamining the Wildland Urban Interface and the Personal Responsibility Narrative</h3>
<p>The WUI is a catch-all term to describe an ever expanding area in the U.S. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-radeloffRapidGrowthUS2018"><strong>radeloffRapidGrowthUS2018?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-carlsonWildlandUrbanInterface2022"><strong>carlsonWildlandUrbanInterface2022?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-mockrinGrowthWildlandurbanInterface2022"><strong>mockrinGrowthWildlandurbanInterface2022?</strong></a>)</span>. Frequently characterized as the “Wildland Urban Interface fire problem” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cohenWildlandurbanInterfaceFire2008"><strong>cohenWildlandurbanInterfaceFire2008?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-mellWildlandUrbanInterface2010"><strong>mellWildlandUrbanInterface2010?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-maranghidesFrameworkAddressingNational2013"><strong>maranghidesFrameworkAddressingNational2013?</strong></a>)</span>, more homes in the WUI is an oft-cited reason for the increase in exposure of communities to wildfire <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hawbakerChangesWildfireOccurrence2023"><strong>hawbakerChangesWildfireOccurrence2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-weiEstimatingWUIExposure2023"><strong>weiEstimatingWUIExposure2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-barrettWildlandUrbanInterfaceProblem2021"><strong>barrettWildlandUrbanInterfaceProblem2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-calkinHowRiskManagement2014"><strong>calkinHowRiskManagement2014?</strong></a>)</span>. A newspaper article discussing Colorado’s three largest wildfires in 2020, explains, “As the Wildland Urban Interface grows, so is the risk of larger and more destructive fires…” This implies, simplistically, that the size and severity of wildfires can all be explained by the contemporaneous growth of the WUI, growing at a similar rate, with the same levels of exposure everywhere. It erases the historical context for why we are increasingly experiencing more extreme wildfires today — including climate change, Indigenous land dispossession, and federal forest management which suppressed fire for over a century — while placing the blame on individual homeowners who <em>choose</em> to put themselves in harms way. The question of choice in residential location is complicated by many factors, among them affordability, work <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schirmerRoleLocationResidential2014"><strong>schirmerRoleLocationResidential2014?</strong></a>)</span>, and a housing shortage to the tune of four to seven million homes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-horowitzSurveyFindsLarge2023"><strong>horowitzSurveyFindsLarge2023?</strong></a>)</span>. Furthermore, nearly any location where people reside will be exposed to some kind of natural hazard, whether fire, flooding, extreme heat, or earthquakes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NationalRiskIndex2023"><strong>NationalRiskIndex2023?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>While it is important to recognize the impact of housing growth in areas more prone to wildfire occurrence, most discussions of the WUI and the homes within it contribute to an idea of <em>the</em> WUI; that is, a homogeneous zone where all communities are similarly geographically situated and with uniform levels of risk and housing growth. This hypothetical WUI is typically conceptualized as a forested landscape in the western U.S. near federally managed lands on which the density of homes is ever increasing. In reality, communities who live in what I prefer to call fire adapted landscapes are diverse, located throughout various geographic regions across the country, and have differing levels of risk, home distribution, density, and growth <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-maranghidesWUIStructureParcel2022"><strong>maranghidesWUIStructureParcel2022?</strong></a>)</span>. A recent study, for example, found that more homes are exposed and destroyed by wildfires in grasslands and shrublands than in forests <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-radeloffRisingWildfireRisk2023"><strong>radeloffRisingWildfireRisk2023?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Much of the living with fire literature directed at homeowners in areas traditionally associated with the WUI is characterized by an emphasis on individual responsibility <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coloradostateforestserviceHomeIgnitionZone2021"><strong>coloradostateforestserviceHomeIgnitionZone2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-petersonFireAdaptedCommunities2016"><strong>petersonFireAdaptedCommunities2016?</strong></a>)</span> for reducing wildfire risk on private property. Some of the literature also makes the assumption that homeowners expect the government, and in particular, the federal government, to save their homes from wildfire. In the Home Ignition Zone guide published by the CSFS, it states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>As more people choose to live in wildfire adapted areas, additional homes and lives are potentially threatened every year</strong>. Firefighters always do their best to protect residents, but <strong>ultimately, it is your responsibility to protect your property and investments from wildfire</strong> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coloradostateforestserviceHomeIgnitionZone2021"><strong>coloradostateforestserviceHomeIgnitionZone2021?</strong></a>, my emphasis)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an otherwise insightful article by some leading thinkers about wildfire, the authors commend the efforts of a county wildfire mitigation program in part because it “…builds wildfire resiliency from the bottom up and <strong>helps temper the expectation that the federal government is exclusively responsible for community protection</strong>” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-calkinWildlandurbanFireDisasters2023"><strong>calkinWildlandurbanFireDisasters2023?</strong></a>, my emphasis)</span>.</p>
<p>In the book <em>Living with Fire</em>, the authors repeat the narrative about the perceived responsibility of the federal government to protect a small number of Americans while contradicting themselves elsewhere by stating that large numbers of people live in the WUI (p. 47):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By putting the protection of private property ahead of other management concerns, we effectively manage our vast tracts of public wilderness for the benefit of a relatively few residents of the wildland-urban interface <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-jensenToolsLivingFire2008"><strong>jensenToolsLivingFire2008?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The specific language of “personal responsibility” in relation to homeowners reducing wildfire risk also appears in a homeowner guide from the National Interagency Fire Center <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ReadySetGo"><strong>ReadySetGo?</strong></a>)</span> and is enshrined in language from Colorado Senate Bill 22-007 in its direction to fund the Live Wildfire Ready program:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While homeowners and property owners in Colorado bear the ultimate responsibility to prepare their homes and property for wildfire, many still do not understand this responsibility, the risk they face living in the wildland-urban interface, or the necessary steps to reduce their wildfire risk <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-leclairLiveWildfireReady2023"><strong>leclairLiveWildfireReady2023?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CSFS takes the personal responsibility narrative one step further, suggesting that people need to “accept responsibility for living in an area with wildfire hazards” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-petersonFireAdaptedCommunities2016"><strong>petersonFireAdaptedCommunities2016?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>I do not mean to suggest that all fire practitioners espouse these exact narratives, nor to discount the important risk reduction efforts and support for communities at various levels of government and among nonprofits in Colorado, even if some of these entities harness similar kinds of narratives in their work. Rather, I hope this contribution enhances the effectiveness and relationship-building capacities of these entities in their engagements with different communities throughout Colorado in relation to wildfire.</p>

<div id="an-overview-of-the-literature-on-wildfire-risk-perception" class="section level3" number="3.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> An Overview of the Literature on Wildfire Risk Perception</h3>
<p>The origins of and reasons why the personal responsibility narrative is so pervasive may be linked to a broader cultural shift, from a conception of collective risk following the New Deal, to the assignment of risk to the individual in subsequent decades <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-collierNeoliberalismNaturalDisaster2014"><strong>collierNeoliberalismNaturalDisaster2014?</strong></a>)</span>. This aligns with the neoliberal paradigm of resilience in the context of risk management, where personal responsibility may be seen as a proxy for resilience. This approach institutionalizes the mobilization of individuals to take responsibility for their own welfare while they are at the same time overseen within “a sphere of governance”<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-josephResilienceEmbeddedNeoliberalism2013"><strong>josephResilienceEmbeddedNeoliberalism2013?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There has been considerable research into individual and community risk perception of wildfire and flooding, which does not find conclusively that people lack responsibility or perceive that the federal government should be responsible for mitigating risk, nor does the literature suggest messaging personal responsibility to individual homeowners as an effective strategy in risk reduction efforts. Some studies directly contradict these narratives, showing the majority of residents understand wildfire risk to their homes, and do not expect the government to mitigate risk on private property <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mccaffreyOutreachProgramsPeer2011"><strong>mccaffreyOutreachProgramsPeer2011?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-brenkert-smithLivingWildfirePark2023"><strong>brenkert-smithLivingWildfirePark2023?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>What the literature on risk perception and attitudes toward mitigation does show is that there is considerable heterogeneity in how individuals and communities perceive risk and responsibility, even of the same wildfire event <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-edgeleyCharacterizingDivergentExperiences2022"><strong>edgeleyCharacterizingDivergentExperiences2022?</strong></a>)</span>. Perceived risk may not be the same across hazards. Previous experience with flooding, for example, may be a good predictor of individual and collective flood mitigation action <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-burnettFactorsInfluencingFlood2023"><strong>burnettFactorsInfluencingFlood2023?</strong></a>)</span>, whereas previous experience with wildfire results in more variable perceptions of future risk <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-martinRoleRiskPerceptions2009"><strong>martinRoleRiskPerceptions2009?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-ghasemiExaminationSocialpsychologicalDrivers2020"><strong>ghasemiExaminationSocialpsychologicalDrivers2020?</strong></a>)</span>. A number of studies suggest that risk exposure, the reasons people live in the places they do, and how they perceive wildfire mitigation by different actors varies according to cultural, geographic, institutional, historical, and land use factors <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mccaffreyUnderstandingPublicPerspectives2007"><strong>mccaffreyUnderstandingPublicPerspectives2007?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-brightContextBeliefsAttitudes2007"><strong>brightContextBeliefsAttitudes2007?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-edgeleyCharacterizingDivergentExperiences2022"><strong>edgeleyCharacterizingDivergentExperiences2022?</strong></a>)</span>. Results from this extensive literature over nearly two decades point to the importance of localized context in understanding risk and social dynamics and adaptive capacity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mccaffreyUnderstandingPublicPerspectives2007"><strong>mccaffreyUnderstandingPublicPerspectives2007?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-paveglioUnderstandingSocialImpact2015"><strong>paveglioUnderstandingSocialImpact2015?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-paveglioExploringSocialCharacteristics2012"><strong>paveglioExploringSocialCharacteristics2012?</strong></a>)</span> and in establishing trust and acknowledging local values <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vaskeSalientValueSimilarity2007"><strong>vaskeSalientValueSimilarity2007?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The literature does not seem to support the efficacy of messaging personal responsibility in reducing risk nor the need to impugn people for where they choose to live, the reasons for which are complex. A fire adaptation strategy which conceptually separates — with judgement — those who choose to live in the WUI from those who do not is shortsighted for a number of reasons. First, different kinds of hazards exist everywhere. Just because someone does not live in the WUI does not mean they are not exposed to other kinds of hazards. Following the CPF, for example, when sediment transport facilitated through flooding compromised downstream water quality and supply, it was the populations in cities largely thought to be outside the WUI who were vulnerable.</p>
<p>Second, it may be necessary to expand our idea of what constitutes the WUI and who lives there. A year after the CPF, the state’s largest fire by acreage, Colorado suffered its most destructive wildfire, which began as a grass fire and spread into suburban neighborhoods, burning over 1,000 homes mostly surrounded by low density vegetation in less than a day, along with a Tesla dealership, and damaged several big box stores surrounded by impervious surfaces <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chulahwatImpactWindCharacteristics2024"><strong>chulahwatImpactWindCharacteristics2024?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-swainDeadlyDynamicsColorado2022"><strong>swainDeadlyDynamicsColorado2022?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Third, the personal responsibility narrative conceptually isolates wildfire risk to the fire itself, obscuring the risks associated with wildfire smoke, which are usually much more widely geographically distributed <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wilmotExpandingNumberWestern2021"><strong>wilmotExpandingNumberWestern2021?</strong></a>)</span>. A recent study estimates that more than 50,000 deaths in California between 2008 and 2018 are attributable to fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-connollyMortalityAttributablePM22024"><strong>connollyMortalityAttributablePM22024?</strong></a>)</span>. Extreme heat, rarely geographically isolated, sometimes accompanies and exacerbates wildfire risk and spread <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ruffaultIncreasedLikelihoodHeatinduced2020"><strong>ruffaultIncreasedLikelihoodHeatinduced2020?</strong></a>)</span>. Flooding is another risk associated with wildfires in forested watersheds, the impacts from which can also impact communities many miles downstream from where the wildfire occurred, not only those in the WUI.</p>
<p>Finally, this narrative masks the ways that people who live in the WUI may contribute to risk mitigation. The personal responsibility narrative precludes the opportunity to cultivate relationships between communities and fire practitioners which mobilize residents as invested partners in addressing multiple hazards related to wildfire. Rather than assuming people are not responsible, acknowledging the stewardship role communities can and may already be playing provides those communities with a sense of agency. Legislation accompanied by funding that supported the agency of WUI residents would help wildfire mitigation efforts move beyond the — albeit important — home ignition zone to empower individuals and communities to more actively engage with fire management themselves, for example through prescribed burning. As previously mentioned, a persistent narrative is that communities in the WUI expect the federal government to protect them from wildfire <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-calkinWildlandurbanFireDisasters2023"><strong>calkinWildlandurbanFireDisasters2023?</strong></a>)</span>. Although expectations of professional firefighters vary by community <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brenkert-smithLivingWildfirePark2023"><strong>brenkert-smithLivingWildfirePark2023?</strong></a>)</span>, one way to temper expectations of the federal government to perform community protection is to expand fire management capacity beyond federal responsibility to include private landowners. This is not just my aspiration but is part of the mission of organizations like The Ember Alliance<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> or the Fire Networks and is supported by some who work for the USFS, the dominant fire management agency at the federal level. One USFS employee who works in planning told me, “I think there’s a degree of supporting people’s self-determination and their kind of natural rights to use fire. Part of being fire adapted is being able to use fire as a tool, as a landowner, as an interested party, as a fire department, as a whoever.”</p>
<p>Communication with homeowners in the WUI could benefit from reframing, moving away from a narrative of personal responsibility to a language of shared stewardship. This language is already being used to some degree in grey literature, and in scholarship on flood mitigation<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kooistraInstitutionalizingUnitedStates2022"><strong>kooistraInstitutionalizingUnitedStates2022?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-burnettFactorsInfluencingFlood2023"><strong>burnettFactorsInfluencingFlood2023?</strong></a>)</span>, but it is not typically the language used in wildfire risk reduction literature aimed at homeowners nor, from what I observed, in face-to-face interactions with community members. It would be beneficial to fire management, to communities in the WUI, and to all of society if policymakers recognized those particular communities who live near federal lands as potential stewards and supported their existing self-mobilization towards living safely with fire. I offer examples and evidence from ethnographic research in the Poudre Canyon to support my arguments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="study-area" class="section level2" number="3.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Study Area</h2>
<p>The upper Poudre Canyon is an unincorporated community in Larimer County in northern Colorado, west of Fort Collins, the largest nearby city. Just under half of Larimer County’s population lives in the WUI <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-LarimerCountyWildfire"><strong>LarimerCountyWildfire?</strong></a>)</span>. This study area was chosen for several reasons. First, the landscape and its people were heavily affected by the CPF, including persistent wildfire smoke exposure, long evacuations — up to seventy-three days — large-scale loss of forests, and structure loss. Beginning in 2021, the first year after the fire, and persisting through 2024, the upper Poudre has also experienced damaging and catastrophic flooding and debris flows. A debris flow in the Black Hollow drainage, one of thousands of tributaries to the Poudre River, killed four people and destroyed six homes in July 2021.</p>
<p>Second, it is a quintessential WUI community in the sense that it is entirely surrounded by forested public lands (the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest), but it does not align with other assumptions about the WUI, specifically the idea of ever-expanding housing development. It therefore offers an instructive lens through which to highlight the importance of understanding the local context of each community’s circumstances when addressing wildfire challenges, as earlier scholarship suggests <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mccaffreyCommunityWildfirePreparedness2015"><strong>mccaffreyCommunityWildfirePreparedness2015?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-paveglioCategorizingSocialContext2015"><strong>paveglioCategorizingSocialContext2015?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-yadavIncreasingWildfiresChanging2023"><strong>yadavIncreasingWildfiresChanging2023?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>For the census tract corresponding most closely to the upper Poudre Canyon, the population decreased between the 2010 and 2020 censuses, even while a neighboring census tract, also rural, increased in population (though only by 170 people) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-20102020Census2022"><strong>20102020Census2022?</strong></a>)</span>. There are few families with children in the upper Poudre, and the one-room schoolhouse was closed by the school district in 1994 due to low numbers of enrollment. Many, if not the majority, of the residents in the upper Poudre are 65 and older.</p>
<p>Coincident with declining population growth, new development is limited. This is in part due to topographic constraints on building sites because of the steep canyon walls. Also, 85% of land along the river corridor belongs to the federal government, primarily the USFS <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-CachePoudreWild1990"><strong>CachePoudreWild1990?</strong></a>)</span>, and new commercial development is limited by Larimer County.</p>
<p>Development has waxed and waned since the mid-1800s, following the expulsion of the area’s Indigenous inhabitants by the state, who included the Nunt’zi (Ute), Hinono’eino’ (Northern Arapaho), Tsistsistas (Cheyenne), NeI (Shoshone), and Paneassa (Pawnee) — <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-burrisPeoplePoudreEthnohistory2006">Burris 2006</a>)</span>. Colonial settlement in Colorado, as across the western U.S., was encouraged through the Homestead Act of 1862 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-EarlySettlements"><strong>EarlySettlements?</strong></a>)</span> to promote agriculture, mining, and trade and attract non-Indigenous settlement in the valley <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-burrisPeoplePoudreEthnohistory2006">Burris 2006</a>)</span>. For the upper Poudre, existing settlements, or what are now viewed as incursions into the WUI, can be directly traced back to a concerted effort by the federal government to encourage population expansion in this area. A number of homes in the upper Poudre are over a hundred years old, and some of them precede the establishment of a national forest in 1908 in the Poudre Canyon <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-HistoryCulture"><strong>HistoryCulture?</strong></a>)</span>. Historic homes were among those that burned in the upper Poudre, including a home and outbuildings dating to the 1880s belonging to my family. The area with the largest population density in the upper Poudre used to be a ranch and was subdivided in the 1960s, the last significant spate of development in this part of the canyon.</p>
<p>A one-size-fits-all WUI narrative does not accurately characterize each community facing wildfire risk. For the upper Poudre, increasing settlement in the WUI is not what contributes to greater wildfire exposure. Contributions may include the legacy of fire suppression on USFS lands allowing fuel to build up, climate change, and the dispossession of Indigenous peoples who may have conducted periodic burning, especially in valley bottoms <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bakerIndiansFireRocky2002"><strong>bakerIndiansFireRocky2002?</strong></a>)</span>. From 1905, when the USFS was established as an agency, until 1978, it executed a policy of complete fire suppression <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vanwagtendonkHistoryEvolutionWildland2007">van Wagtendonk 2007</a>)</span>, altering fire adapted ecosystems. Operationally, since then, it has been difficult for the USFS to move beyond an overemphasis on fire suppression <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-butlerUSFireLearning2010"><strong>butlerUSFireLearning2010?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-northReformForestFire2015"><strong>northReformForestFire2015?</strong></a>)</span> in part because they are tasked both with restoring fire adapted ecosystems while limiting wildfires which endanger lives or property <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pietruszkaConsequentialLightningcausedWildfires2023"><strong>pietruszkaConsequentialLightningcausedWildfires2023?</strong></a>)</span> and contending with competing fire management mandates across state and federal jurisdictions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schultzCollaborationsCapacitiesTransform2019"><strong>schultzCollaborationsCapacitiesTransform2019?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the entire Poudre Canyon, there are 750 full-time and 1,500 part-time residents, but it draws over 500,000 recreational visitors a year <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Us2024"><strong>Us2024?</strong></a>)</span>. The Poudre River parallels Highway 14 for nearly fifty miles as it flows along the contours of steep, forested slopes and rocky outcrops, supplying water for hundreds of thousands of people in the populous Front Range cities of Fort Collins and Greeley. The Poudre Canyon’s two main population centers are divided between the lower and upper canyon, forty minutes apart by car. In 2012, the High Park Fire swept through the lower Poudre and nearby communities, destroying 259 homes. In 2020, the CPF burned over much of the upper Poudre, lasted nearly four months, and became the state’s largest wildfire in a year during which the three largest wildfires in Colorado occurred <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-BennetWelcomes792022"><strong>BennetWelcomes792022?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The Poudre River watershed drains around 1,889 square miles in the Poudre Canyon alone, and in populated areas of the Poudre, some of the river’s thousands of miles of tributaries pass through private lands, often in their lowest reaches before reaching the river. The largest numbers of people continue to be based in proximity to creeks or on flat lands where early settlers could ranch, mine, or extract timber, which was sent down the river during the years 1868 to 1885 to use as railroad ties <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-evansCachePoudreNatural1991"><strong>evansCachePoudreNatural1991?</strong></a>)</span>. This topography, formed by thousands of years of geologic movement, combined with land use and ownership established over shorter timescales, help shape the way people in the Poudre Canyon experienced two large wildfires and the post-fire flooding following these wildfires.</p>
<p>These patterns of settlement in the geography of the Poudre Canyon may benefit larger risk reduction and recovery efforts, as I will describe further in the Results section of this paper. This is due in part to the role private landowners can play in collaborating with other stakeholders to implement efficient mitigation strategies when these may not be available to a large agency like the USFS, which is beholden to different mandates.</p>

<div id="participant-observation-1" class="section level3" number="3.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Participant Observation</h3>
<p>For over two years from June 2022-October 2024, I lived in the upper Poudre Canyon and participated in activities such as social events, community association and fire board meetings, and site visits to private property and USFS lands impacted by wildfire or flooding. I joined the Poudre Canyon Fire Protection District (PCFPD) as a volunteer, which is a small, entirely volunteer-run fire district, operating over the length of the canyon and beyond. The PCFPD facilitates the use of the river corridor and its surrounding national forest lands by 500,000-800,000 visitors a year, responding to vehicle accidents, medical emergencies, and attending to abandoned campfires, lightning strikes catching something on fire, or a burning vehicle alighting surrounding vegetation. The PCFPD helps residents with chipping and pile burning of woody debris generated by removal of vegetation by homeowners around their homes to reduce their wildfire risk. In collaboration with Larimer County, PCFPD assesses homes for wildfire risk at homeowners’ requests, generates a report for the homeowner, and applies for grants to assist homeowners with wildfire mitigation. PCFPD first responders make the Poudre River corridor, hiking trails, and surrounding areas, safer places to study, fish, paddle, camp, drive, hike, or climb. Over many years, more community members than not have volunteered their time and services to the fire district, either as first responders or on the fire board. Others serve the PCFPD by making meals for monthly firefighter trainings. Services provided by the PCFPD benefits not only the Poudre Canyon community but all who move through it and make use of the river and surrounding public lands.</p>

<div id="interviews-1" class="section level3" number="3.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Interviews</h3>
<p>I conducted fifty semi-structured interviews with different stakeholders, including community members, wildland fire, emergency and watershed management practitioners, and scientists whose studies intersect with ecological, geological, or social aspects of wildfire, post-fire flooding, or recovery. Of these, twelve also included open-ended conversations while walking in the CPF burn scar or accompanying researchers doing scientific fieldwork, a kind of walking interview <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-evansWalkingInterviewMethodology2011"><strong>evansWalkingInterviewMethodology2011?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-carpianoComeTakeWalk2009"><strong>carpianoComeTakeWalk2009?</strong></a>)</span>. I also used go-alongs <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kusenbachStreetPhenomenologyGoEthnographic2003"><strong>kusenbachStreetPhenomenologyGoEthnographic2003?</strong></a>)</span>, a qualitative research method offering a “relational perspective on place and space” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-carpianoComeTakeWalk2009"><strong>carpianoComeTakeWalk2009?</strong></a> 263)</span> to accompany three different teams of scientists — fluvial geomorphologists, biogeochemists, and geologists — in six wildfire-impacted watersheds during their fieldwork, and thirteen scientists and fire/watershed managers within areas of the CPF burn perimeter. I identified participants by meeting them at community events, conferences, and other events, through literature reviews, and snowball sampling. Interviews with both community members and subject-matter experts consisted of open-ended questions loosely organized around how participants were making sense of the CPF and everything that came after it. Interviews were primarily conducted in person, with twelve conducted over Zoom and one over the phone, and lasted between 45 minutes and two hours. All except six interviews were recorded and transcribed, and all were coded in NVivo. I refer to participants with pseudonyms.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Results</h2>
<p>In this section, I discuss four aspects of living with fire in the Poudre Canyon. First, residing in the Poudre facilitates ongoing relationships to the land, and to fire, forests, and water. Second, collaborations with private landowners on watershed recovery after the CPF point to the potential role of landowners as stewards in mitigating different kinds of risk. Third, the PCFPD responds to and helps mitigate a broad spectrum of hazards, including wildfire, providing services which benefit the local community, recreational visitors, agencies, and populations downstream. The widespread involvement of community members with the fire district over time cultivates a broad understanding of the risks associated with living in a rural, mountainous landscape like the Poudre, risks which include but are not limited to wildfire. Fourth, at the same time, my findings show people across the three interview groups need time to adjust to living in an era with more extreme wildfire, what the historian Stephen Pyne calls the Pyrocene <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pyneWelcomePyrocene2021"><strong>pyneWelcomePyrocene2021?</strong></a>)</span>, or the age of fire, characterized by wildfires and subsequent watershed responses which defy what most people have previously experienced in their lifetimes. Below, I examine these four elements of living with fire and argue that they contribute to a stewardship framework as a basis for cultivating fire adapted communities.</p>
<div id="rootedness-in-place" class="section level3" number="3.5.1">

<p>“Well, lovey, does it look like four feet to you?” Richard asked, referring to the diameter of a 500-year-old ponderosa pine which had been killed in the CPF. We were trying to eyeball how big it actually was. Richard and his sister Char, who together run the only remaining lumber mill in the vicinity of the Poudre Canyon, had stopped by my family’s property in October 2023 to see how the CPF had affected the land, which the two siblings had known since they were children. “I hate to see a big tree like that die,” Richard said.</p>
<p>People who live in the Poudre have a close relationship to forests and fire. Because there is no natural gas line up the Poudre Canyon and electricity and propane are expensive, many people collect firewood each year to use in their woodstoves for heat, either from USFS lands, their own lands, or from neighbors’ lands. One family hosts a communal firewood cutting day, and in the aftermath of the CPF, people have gathered to help neighbors clean up hazard or fallen trees.</p>
<p>Residents use local toponyms to refer to prominent geographic features, and some families have their own toponyms for places of significance to them, names which do not appear on any map, such as The Old Man’s Face or The Spire. These names root people in place over time. The Silent Forest, for example, is a section of forest off of a USFS trail far enough from the nearby creek that one cannot hear it, known by this name by multiple generations of just one family which lives nearby. Places are imbued with meaning because they evoke memories of experiences, people, and events of the pasts, <em>and</em> because of their present materiality <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-bassoWisdomSitsPlaces1996"><strong>bassoWisdomSitsPlaces1996?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The intimacy of the connection which people in the Poudre Canyon have to the landscape in which they live demonstrates an investment in and attention to the health of that environment, developed through attachment to place through the process of settlement over time, what may be termed “settlerism” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-johnsonSettlerSensibilitiesEnvironmental2023">Johnson 2023</a>)</span>. The acknowledgement of these local connections, histories, and knowledges by fire, forest, and emergency managers could facilitate relationship building with local residents toward the creation of shared goals in adapting to smoke, fire, and floods in the environment of the upper Poudre.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<div id="post-fire-stewardship" class="section level3" number="3.5.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> Post-fire Stewardship</h3>
<p>Watershed recovery, implemented in collaboration with private landowners, resulted in time-sensitive work and benefited a wide geographic area and population base extending far beyond the Poudre Canyon, a form of emergent stewardship following the CPF. Below, I explain how this work provided protective benefits for residents in the Poudre who were exposed to flooding after CPF, and how it also continues to benefit the much larger populations in Fort Collins and Greeley who rely on the Poudre River for drinking water, as well as the hundreds of thousands of recreational visitors to the canyon each year who swim, paddle, and fish in the river.</p>
<p>As of August 2024, flooding has occurred every summer on tributaries of the Poudre River, resulting in life and structure loss and impacting private lands and property, county and state roads, acquatic life, and water quality of the Poudre River. Watersheds subjected to wildfire can experience changing hydrological and geomorphological conditions making them more susceptible to flooding or debris flows <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rengersLandslidesWildfireInitiation2020">Rengers et al. 2020</a>)</span>. Wildfire also increases the availability of sediment that can be transported downstream and changes the biogeochemical composition of water with implications for water quality <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wilsonConnectivityPostfireRunoff2021"><strong>wilsonConnectivityPostfireRunoff2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-sanchezPhysicalBiogeochemicalDrivers2023"><strong>sanchezPhysicalBiogeochemicalDrivers2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-rhoadesLegacySevereWildfire2019"><strong>rhoadesLegacySevereWildfire2019?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-hohnerWildfiresAlterForest2019"><strong>hohnerWildfiresAlterForest2019?</strong></a>)</span>. In the upper Poudre, the vast majority of tributaries to the Poudre River originate on USFS land, and at least eight of these empty into the river on private lands, such as Black Hollow Creek. Following the CPF, watershed restoration was a high priority for a wide range of stakeholders.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2021, the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), made Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) funds available to perform flood mitigation work on private lands in the Poudre Canyon. The NRCS is empowered to support work on private lands, whereas the USFS, which is also part of the USDA, is not. Larimer County and the City of Greeley, the latter which holds water rights to much of the Poudre River for its drinking water and was a municipal sponsor for the EWP funds, split the burden of overseeing EWP-funded flood mitigation geographically. The local government sponsor typically provides a 20% match to the EWP funds, but in this case, the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) provided the match on behalf of Greeley. The Coalition for the Poudre River Watershed (CPRW) helped coordinate watershed recovery efforts and located supplemental funding from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) for additional mitigation work. A consulting company was hired to design and implement flood mitigation for those areas overseen by Greeley, whereas the county’s own engineers performed this work where they were responsible. Because Greeley has a vested interest in the water quality of the Poudre River, the consulting company designed flood mitigation to protect private property and also catch sediment before it reaches the river. The involvement of CPRW and the interest of CDPHE in funding flood mitigation reflect the value placed on watershed health and its impacts on all who live in that watershed, including downstream water users.</p>
<p>A number of tributaries in the upper Poudre and surrounding areas which pass through private lands also happen to represent some of the most widely and severely burned watersheds, including at their headwaters. A research biogeochemist with the USFS told me that these are indicators of how much potential these tributaries have to negatively contribute to poor water quality of the river. Installing sediment retention structures on these tributaries as soon as possible after the CPF was important in protecting downstream water quality as well as private roads, homes, and bridges. I was told most of this work done in the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023 was on private property, not only for the purposes of protecting assets on private lands but because it was easier, less time-consuming, and less restrictive to coordinate with private landowners than the USFS, which has prohibitive permitting requirements. In some cases, access to these tributaries was facilitated via private bridges over the river, without which these lower reaches would be inaccessible. That the majority of watershed recovery work has occurred on private lands is also reflected in an online project map put together by CPRW <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-CameronPeakFire2022"><strong>CameronPeakFire2022?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>It may be worth exploring other multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency collaborations with private landowners in preparing for and recovering from wildfires in different WUI, land ownership, and watershed contexts. This case study demonstrates that the presence of and collaboration with private landowners living in proximity to USFS lands in post-fire watershed recovery positively impacted watersheds, private landowners, and geographically diverse sections of society.</p>
<p>In the next section, I describe another way in which people in the upper Poudre are active stewards in mitigating risk with benefits for a much broader population base and geographic area.</p>

<div id="living-with-and-mitigating-risks" class="section level3" number="3.5.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.3</span> Living With and Mitigating Risks</h3>
<p>We were a motley crew of volunteer firefighters from different departments, some with kitted out wildland firefighting backpacks, others with fire shelters attached through our belt loops and small plastic water bottles stuffed into the pockets of our Nomex (fire resistant) pants. Our group was responsible for curtailing the progression of the south flank of the Stove Prairie Fire which had started that afternoon in a dry wash riddled with trash and various kinds of shooting targets, including golf balls, bowling pins, plywood, and clay pigeons. In this wash used as an unofficial shooting range, some people had inadvertently started a fire on this windy, dry April day when their bullets caused a spark (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>In rural, unincorporated communities around the state of Colorado, local, volunteer fire districts are the first line of defense against wildfires as well as other hazards. Perhaps because of the aforementioned widespread community involvement with the PCFPD, most community members understand the multiple risks associated with living and recreating up the Poudre, from rockfall on the narrow canyon highway to trees falling on cars at a national forest campground (see Figure 2). Rather than bucking responsibility related to living in the WUI, people up the Poudre have nuanced understandings of the complex ecosystem of risks involved in living there, of which residing in a fire adapted landscape is but one consideration. Furthermore, PCFPD volunteers, and the wider community of earlier volunteers, are assets to a wide range of stakeholders and land managers because of their presence and service in a landscape where the jurisdiction of responding to emergencies or wildfires would otherwise fall entirely to the county or to the USFS, whose employees live in Fort Collins, up to three hours away from the areas to which PCFPD responds.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.4</span> <em>There’s going to come a day when Colorado’s going to catch on fire</em></h3>
<p>Back before 2012, the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest was known as the “asbestos forest” to wildland firefighters based out of Fort Collins because it never seemed to burn. People in the Poudre spoke about small wildfires they had previously experienced which were quickly put out, and there is a record of wildfires in the general area dating from 1893 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fryCachePoudreRiver1954"><strong>fryCachePoudreRiver1954?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-schneiderForestFiresPoudre2020"><strong>schneiderForestFiresPoudre2020?</strong></a>)</span>. The 2012 High Park Fire was the first wildfire with devastating consequences for the Poudre Canyon, including evacuations, loss of homes, and subsequent flooding. Most of these impacts were felt by lower canyon residents because the wildfire never entered the upper portion of the canyon, although it affected access and shaped expectations throughout the Poudre Canyon about the future possibility of destructive fire.</p>
<p>At the time, the PCFPD fire chief lived in the lower Poudre. He and his wife had moved to the Poudre in 2008 from California, where he had been a career structural and wildland firefighter. The High Park Fire began on June 8, 2012 and was contained by July 1, 2012, before the onset of the summer monsoon in Colorado, characterized by frequent afternoon thunderstorms usually beginning in July and lasting into August <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-NorthAmericanMonsoon2023"><strong>NorthAmericanMonsoon2023?</strong></a>)</span>. Based on his wide-ranging experiences with wildfire in California, Chris, the fire chief, expected that flooding from tributaries that burned would occur during the summer. He asked the Larimer County Office of Emergency Management for sandbags in anticipation but was told “It doesn’t flood here. This is a different kind of soil than in California.”</p>
<p>As Chris predicted, when the monsoon began, the tributaries began flooding and damaging homes, and the county did eventually provide sand and bags to be filled. Later they even provided an automated sandbag filler, which Chris would fill with sand using his tractor. At first, it was up to the community to fill the bags, and Chris again used his prior experience to help properly fill bags and place them to deflect water effectively. Even those in the community who did not need sandbags jumped in to help. “I mean, it just doesn’t happen like that in L.A.,” Chris explained.</p>
<p>These experiences during the High Park Fire point to the learning curve that comes with living with fire, by government agencies and the public alike. In 2013, heavy rains resulted in a swollen Poudre River which primarily impacted Fort Collins with extensive flooding, through which lower reaches of the Poudre River flow. The 2013 floods jumpstarted a number of watershed coalitions — including CPRW — along the Front Range through funding provided by a Community Development Block Grant for disaster recovery through Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These back-to-back disasters in 2012 and 2013 shaped how individuals and various government agencies perceive wildfire and flooding and respond to it today. For many in the upper Poudre, PCFPD firefighters notwithstanding, the kind of extreme fire behavior, high burn severity, and massive acreage that characterized the CPF eight years after High Park and which dramatically altered the landscape in which they live was not something they had intimately experienced before. The 2012 High Park Fire was the first major wildfire to dramatically impact the canyon, but even it did not burn for as long, affect as much acreage, or burn at such high levels of severity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-HighParkFire2012"><strong>HighParkFire2012?</strong></a>)</span>. I heard from multiple community members in the upper Poudre that they always associated flooding risk with the main stem of the Poudre River, not with its tributaries. This was informed by either knowledge of an 1891 dam breach which caused a catastrophic flood on the Poudre or of the Big Thompson Flood of 1976 in a neighboring canyon which killed 144 people. People in the upper Poudre had rare experiences with flooding on tributaries. Black Hollow Creek, which turned into the tragic debris flow in 2021, was mostly a babbling brook over the course of sixty years during which one of the Black Hollow residents had observed it. The debris flow changed the way people understand the relationship between fire and flood and the potential for much smaller watersheds to present the greatest danger of flooding.</p>
<p>At the 2023 Colorado Wildland Fire Conference, some fire and watershed practitioners and scientists expressed incredulity that landowners who were informed the tributaries near their homes were likely to flood after the CPF did not believe it because they and their “father’s grandfather” (to quote one of the scientists) had never experienced anything like it. However, I argue that it is reasonable to understand the capacity of a creek to behave in a certain way based on empirical observations collected over a lifetime and historical, situated knowledge passed down from one generation to the next. People who have experienced wildfire and who may be exposed to subsequent hazards like flooding need time and empathy to adjust to the rapidly changed realities of living in a post-wildfire landscape. Part of living with fire is living with altered environments, with cascading hazards, and in some cases, devastation.</p>
<p>Messaging directed toward those who live in fire adapted landscapes implies that people residing in these areas need to learn to live with fire. Yet the Poudre Canyon and its residents have been living with fire for a long time, recounted by multiple longtime residents. Volunteers with the PCFPD respond to a number of wildfires each year. It seems that what is actually meant is that people need to learn to live with catastrophic fire, as well as potentially destructive post-fire flooding. Policymakers and practitioners communicating with communities exposed to wildfire risk need to acknowledge existing relationships with fire and be explicit about what being a fire adapted community means in the context of extreme fires. I suggest that living with fire is not just about removing vegetation from around one’s home. It’s a process of recalibration in response to rapid, large scale, and ongoing changes to vegetation and hydrology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-daurioTemporalRecalibrationsLearning2023"><strong>daurioTemporalRecalibrationsLearning2023?</strong></a>)</span>. Living with fire is also about learning how to navigate complex bureaucratic and administrative systems during and after the fire and coping with loss. This loss may include loss of life, loss of a home, loss of control, or loss of sense of place.</p>
<p>Some of these impacts are not limited to those who live within the burn area. Just as wildfire smoke and water quality affect people far beyond the perimeter of the wildfire, so do the emotional and social dimensions of loss and change. The Fort Collins-based researchers and practitioners I interviewed experienced CPF on a deeper, more personal level because it was in their backyard, in their watershed, at their research sites, and in the places they like to recreate. As one person involved in wildfire policy and forest management for decades said about his colleagues, “People were really kind of wrecked in a lot of different ways. …this is our watershed. This is a place where people have family histories, even people that moved here recently. The first thing they did was to go up and camp, hike, whatever they do. So, people have very strong personal place connections, sense of place for this whole area.” Living with fire is a process, not an event, or a list of mitigation tasks to check off. And we are all of us — those who live in fire adapted landscapes, those who study fire adapted landscapes, and those who govern and manage them — engaged in a process of recalibration, often in response to a wildfire that impacts us personally.</p>

<div id="discussion-1" class="section level2" number="3.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>This ethnographic case study reflects the circumstances of one community affected by wildfire and post-fire flooding and therefore embodies one set of options for how stewardship with private landowners can be cultivated. Other communities facing or already having experienced wildfire will have different perspectives and geographies. This research contributes to literature emergent from CPF and recent wildfires and offers a valuable perspective on how a rural community facilitates stewardship of both private and federal lands and the water that runs through them, and helps mitigate hazards to the benefit of populations outside the community. In addition to the examples I have provided from the Poudre, I advocate for more cross-jurisdictional partnerships with rural communities toward a shared goal of learning how to better live with fire. I argue that reconceptualizing communities residing in fire adapted landscapes as potential stewards opens up pathways for mobilizing these partnerships. It also centers agency for living with fire with communities. Below are several examples of what centering agency could look like.</p>
<p>A study on voluntary and regulatory wildfire risk reduction in two rural unincorporated communities in Wyoming and Utah showed a preference in these communities for greater local agency in implementing and managing wildfire mitigation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-edgeleySupportRegulatoryVoluntary2020"><strong>edgeleySupportRegulatoryVoluntary2020?</strong></a>)</span>. There are good examples of this already happening. In California and a number of other states, for example, Prescribed Burn Associations (PBAs) are community-based, mutual-aid networks which support private landowners in burning on their own lands <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-CaliforniaPrescribedBurn"><strong>CaliforniaPrescribedBurn?</strong></a>)</span>. Organizations like the Fire Networks, The Ember Alliance, and Fire Adapted Colorado advocate for expanding agency over fire management to include local capacity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zotero-10034"><strong>zotero-10034?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-EmberAllianceChanging"><strong>EmberAllianceChanging?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-FireAdaptedColorado"><strong>FireAdaptedColorado?</strong></a>)</span>. A recent Fire Networks blog post suggested harnessing the ranching concept of “neighboring” for community wildfire mitigation initiatives <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-burchfieldNeighboringAntidoteSeparation2024"><strong>burchfieldNeighboringAntidoteSeparation2024?</strong></a>)</span>. There is also emergent research examining the idea of community-based forestry on land owned by different landownership entities and suggestions for further research that examines opportunities for community-based wildfire risk management <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-davisCommunitybasedForestryFederal2020"><strong>davisCommunitybasedForestryFederal2020?</strong></a>)</span>. Stewardship of lands which is co-created by multiple government and nonprofit actors reflects already existing federal goals for addressing wildfire governance <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-FIREReportWildland2023"><strong>FIREReportWildland2023?</strong></a>)</span>. Building on previous work, I encourage the added inclusion of private landowners in consideration of these objectives and in post-fire watershed management <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-charnleyFosteringCollectiveAction2020"><strong>charnleyFosteringCollectiveAction2020?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-kirklandTakingAlllandsApproach2021"><strong>kirklandTakingAlllandsApproach2021?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There is a concerted push on the part of county, state, and federal agencies to create fire adapted communities in order to contend with increasing wildfire exposure to properties and lives. Part of this advocacy is encompassed within messaging crafted by fire and emergency managers to reach those who live in the WUI. In this paper, I question the usefulness of using the term WUI because it homogenizes people, places, and local contexts of wildfire risk. It also geographically limits our perception of wildfire risk and separates how we think about and prepare for other wildfire-related hazards such as smoke and post-fire flooding, the impacts from which are felt far beyond the burn perimeter.</p>
<p>I advocate moving away from the narrative of personal responsibility as a strategy to encourage homeowners to undertake wildfire risk reduction efforts, as it is simply not supported by the literature or data on risk perception and homeowner action/inaction. This narrative also assigns liability to individual homeowners who live in the WUI and creates a false notion that only those who live in the WUI are subject to wildfire-related risks. In cultivating fire adapted communities, I think it is more helpful to characterize wildfire as something with which everyone in society has to contend, whether it is through direct contact with wildfires, wildfire smoke, or post-fire hazards such as flooding or compromised water quality. I argue that reshaping the narrative about those who live in fire adapted landscapes encourages a shift in perspective to understand the people in these communities as allies in cultivating the practice of living with fire. Centering co-stewardship opens up possibilities for collaboration and collective action that may otherwise be foreclosed. Approaching frontline communities as custodians allows us to center care for their well-being and that of the surrounding environment.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Dale had just made himself a drink on the afternoon of July 20, 2021, when the power blinked on and off, and he heard what sounded like a shotgun blast. He later attributed the sound to the destruction of an electricity transformer. He looked outside to see a power pole swinging back and forth even though there was no wind and then noticed his patio was covered in about a foot-and-a-half of mud and water. As he futilely tried to get his patio chairs out of the way, all he could think was, ‘Where is all this water coming from?’ He put his rubber boots on and made his way up through the water to what he calls ‘the shelf,’ a flat area on a hill overlooking Black Hollow Creek which flows by the home his father built.</p>
<p>The creek had grown exponentially in size and volume and created a new channel. He watched in disbelief as one of his neighbor’s homes floated away down the river. There were four people inside that home, all of whom died that day. Five other homes were destroyed, no vehicles could cross the bridge over the river for a week, and the land on which the remaining homes stood had been radically altered by the mass of trees and huge boulders deposited where houses used to be. These homes and the area immediately surrounding them at Black Hollow, as the settlement is known, had been spared in the 2020 Cameron Peak Fire (CPF). But it became a place of destruction and tragedy more than six months after the fire had been declared contained due to a massive debris flow, a phenomenon closely linked to wildfire as an ecological disturbance.</p>
<p>Wildfire can change the hydrological conditions of a watershed in ways that make it more susceptible to flooding or debris flows, in what is known as a cascading hazard <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hydeUncertaintiesPredictingDebris2016"><strong>hydeUncertaintiesPredictingDebris2016?</strong></a>)</span>. Based on my research in a community affected by the CPF, I show how cascading hazards have cascading consequences for people’s lives and social structures writ large. I argue that drawing on existing ecological frameworks of the wildfire-flood disturbance cascade to interrogate the wildfire-social disturbance cascade enables the possibility of responding to wildfire in a way that explicitly links social-ecological systems. I propose that cross-disciplinary teams examine post-fire social-ecological conditions and conduct assessments over longer timescales to help coordinate long-term recovery efforts in response to cascading social and ecological consequences.</p>
<p>In geology, cascading hazards refer to a sequencing of processes, beginning with a primary hazard which precipitates the formation of additional hazards <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sharmaIncreasingRiskCascading2023"><strong>sharmaIncreasingRiskCascading2023?</strong></a>)</span>. This is also sometimes called a disturbance cascade <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nakamuraDisturbanceRegimesStream2000"><strong>nakamuraDisturbanceRegimesStream2000?</strong></a>)</span>. One example of an ecological disturbance with additional hazard potential, and the one germane to the subject of this paper, is a wildfire which leads to post-wildfire flooding and debris flows. In 2020, a year of record-breaking wildfire activity across the western United States <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022"><strong>rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022?</strong></a>)</span>, the CPF funneled through the upper Poudre Canyon in northern Colorado on two days of extreme fire spread. This was followed by extensive flooding and debris flows in the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023, including at Black Hollow.</p>
<p>The physical damage wrought by these intersecting disasters is well documented, and has been quantified in the number of structures destroyed, acres burned, or occurrence of debris flows. The CPF is Colorado’s largest wildfire in state history encompassing 208,912 acres <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-WFIGSInteragencyFire2023"><strong>WFIGSInteragencyFire2023?</strong></a>)</span>, which destroyed 492 structures across sixteen communities and three watersheds, including the Poudre, Big Thompson, and Laramie watersheds <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coalitionforthepoudreriverwatershedCameronPeakFire"><strong>coalitionforthepoudreriverwatershedCameronPeakFire?</strong></a>)</span>. These kinds of statistics appear in research papers <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022"><strong>rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022?</strong></a>)</span>, on state <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-HistoricalWildfireInformation2024"><strong>HistoricalWildfireInformation2024?</strong></a>)</span> and nonprofit websites <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-coalitionforthepoudreriverwatershedCameronPeakFire"><strong>coalitionforthepoudreriverwatershedCameronPeakFire?</strong></a>)</span>, and in newspaper stories <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-larsenCameronPeakFire2020"><strong>larsenCameronPeakFire2020?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-DeadlyFlashFlood2021"><strong>DeadlyFlashFlood2021?</strong></a>)</span>. As such, numbers become the main way impacts from these hazards are narrated and understood by both the public and government officials. These quantifiable categorizations are typical of most disasters, characterizing them as ‘temporary aberrations from normal conditions’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fiskeSlowOnsetDisasterClimate2019"><strong>fiskeSlowOnsetDisasterClimate2019?</strong></a>)</span>, the idea of which shapes frameworks of disaster response procedures in the U.S. Information about emergency response and recovery is similarly quantitatively understood and measured by, for example, acres burned at high severity, inventories of fish species at risk in burned areas <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fairchildFinalFisheriesSpecialist2020"><strong>fairchildFinalFisheriesSpecialist2020?</strong></a>)</span>, or roads most vulnerable to flooding impacts <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-larimercountyofficeofemergencymanagementCameronPeakFire2021"><strong>larimercountyofficeofemergencymanagementCameronPeakFire2021?</strong></a>)</span>. These statistics provide critical information which can be measured against other wildfires and flooding events and offer a sense of both the scale and the number of people or communities who were or are exposed to risk.</p>
<p>Relying primarily on quantitative assessments, however, obscures the varied experiences of contending with multiple hazards, as well as the ongoing ways people’s lives continue to be affected, cascading out from the wildfire, for years to come. Quantitative summaries of disaster can also be mobilized by those actors involved in governance who are fluent in the language of risk analysis to produce quantitative risk assessments which not only overshadow non-quantifiable discourses of uncertainty but also hold a strategic advantage in decision-making processes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-grovesBombMyBackyard2015"><strong>grovesBombMyBackyard2015?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Disaster anthropologists have shown that disaster survivors are uniquely positioned to reflect on the affective experience of the social and material consequences of disasters <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosGoverningAffectNeoliberalism2017">Barrios 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-oliver-smithTheorizingVulnerabilityGlobalized2004"><strong>oliver-smithTheorizingVulnerabilityGlobalized2004?</strong></a>)</span>, and the same is true for those who have experienced wildfire and its associated hazards. The complex, sometimes unanticipated, lived experiences of wildfire are important to uncover and interrogate as a way to help better prepare individuals, governments, and society to plan for, respond to, and recover from a series of disasters propagating out beyond the start and end dates of the wildfire itself.</p>
<p>I suggest that in the context of the CPF, and arguably, in the context of most wildfires, there are ongoing and complex consequences for people’s lives which cannot be easily enumerated and are therefore not as visible to nor considered by the public, policymakers, and fire and emergency managers. How do we account for, acknowledge, and respond to the complex circumstances of people’s lives which result from living through a wildfire? What does recovery look like when we consider the breadth of experiences and account for longer time horizons in our response mechanisms? Focusing on narratives and perspectives emerging from ethnographic fieldwork in the Poudre Canyon, I harness the concept of cascading hazards to examine the accompanying cascading consequences affecting people in this mountainous area of northern Colorado following the CPF.</p>
<p>This article is organized as follows. First, I propose a conceptual framework of the social-ecological disturbance cascade for responding to wildfires. Second, I provide an overview of the literature on wildfire and disturbance in the social sciences and the anthropological approaches I draw on for this paper. Third, I describe my study site and the specific landscape characteristics which support a social-ecological perspective of disturbance. Fourth, I explain the methods I used for my research and why they are relevant for a landscape perspective of wildfire-related disturbance examining human and more than human relations. Fifth, I present and discuss results showing how cascading hazards resulting from wildfires have cascading consequences for people’s lives. Finally, I reflect on the fire and emergency management and policy implications for utilizing a social-ecological disturbance cascade framework and propose one possible strategy for wildfire recovery in the future.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Conceptualizing the Social-ecological Disturbance Cascade</h2>
<p>The disturbance cascade involving wildfire and flooding is well known and oft-studied among those who research geological hazards such as landslides and debris flows <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rengersLandslidesWildfireInitiation2020">Rengers et al. 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-staleyRecurrenceIntervalPostfire2020"><strong>staleyRecurrenceIntervalPostfire2020?</strong></a>)</span> or fluvial geomorphology, the study of the movement of rivers over time and how they shape landforms <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wohlBiogeomorphicInfluencesRiver2022"><strong>wohlBiogeomorphicInfluencesRiver2022?</strong></a>)</span>. Following a wildfire, there is an expectation among the scientific research and watershed management communities that there will be a disturbance cascade <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barnardWildfireClimateChange2023"><strong>barnardWildfireClimateChange2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-hohnerWildfiresAlterForest2019"><strong>hohnerWildfiresAlterForest2019?</strong></a>)</span>, and that post-fire conditions provide an opportunity to study the particular ways the disturbance cascade is enacted in specific watersheds <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gorrTriggeringConditionsRunout2023"><strong>gorrTriggeringConditionsRunout2023?</strong></a>)</span>, which will vary based on a number of ecological, geomorphological, and anthropogenic factors.</p>
<p>Following the CPF and other large-scale wildfires, researchers have been studying changes to soil microbiome diversity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nelsonWildfiredependentChangesSoil2022"><strong>nelsonWildfiredependentChangesSoil2022?</strong></a>)</span>, the relationship between wildfire-induced changes in source water to downstream water supply and agricultural production <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barnardWildfireClimateChange2023"><strong>barnardWildfireClimateChange2023?</strong></a>)</span>, the role of large woody debris in post-fire debris flow sediment retention <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rengersInfluenceLargeWoody2023"><strong>rengersInfluenceLargeWoody2023?</strong></a>)</span>, analysis of post-fire conditions to guide reforestation management <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022"><strong>rodmanHistoric2020Fire2022?</strong></a>)</span>, and how spatial heterogeneity in post-fire mountain watersheds influences the transport of sediment downstream <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wohlBiogeomorphicInfluencesRiver2022"><strong>wohlBiogeomorphicInfluencesRiver2022?</strong></a>)</span>, among many other projects.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the social sciences, I am aware of only one research project related to community member experiences following CPF <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kooistraWebinarResidentsPerspectives2022"><strong>kooistraWebinarResidentsPerspectives2022?</strong></a>)</span> and one project assessing risk management tools during the fire <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-caggianoCameronPeakFire2021"><strong>caggianoCameronPeakFire2021?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There is no commonly used term to describe cascading hazards in the social sciences, even though there is a strong history of social science research on the human dimensions of wildfires, including the recognition of wildfire as having both ecological and social ramifications <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tomanSocialScienceWildlandurban2013"><strong>tomanSocialScienceWildlandurban2013?</strong></a>)</span>. I propose the term social-ecological disturbance cascade to delineate the explicit relationship between a wildfire, its ecological disturbance cascade, and the cascading consequences for people’s lives it sets in motion. My research demonstrates that communities who suffer ongoing impacts from wildfires often experience them in ways connected to the ecological disturbance cascade and could benefit from an approach that mirrors some watershed-specific, longitudinal studies more common in ecological and geological research and restoration of post-wildfire conditions. Acknowledgement and understanding of social-ecological linkages in disturbances among those in positions of power, who formulate policy, and researchers of all backgrounds conducting wildfire and post-wildfire studies which inform policy and management decisions would stimulate and support more comprehensive future wildfire response and recovery efforts that are sensitive to the complex and ongoing needs of people living in wildfire-impacted areas.</p>
<p>Linking the study of ecological and social disturbance cascades facilitates an understanding of wildfire as a phenomenon shaped by and with implications for both ecological and social forces and enables the possibility of inclusive social-ecological responsiveness. Currently, at the federal level, preparation for and response to wildfire is logistically, financially, and administratively separated from preparations and responses associated with flooding caused by wildfires, and from wildfire smoke. Responsibility for these different phenomena is spread across multiple agencies operating under different mandates and with no clear pathway for cross-agency coordination. Wildfire management, including its prevention or reduction in its severity, is primarily the purview of the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). Wildfire smoke, on the other hand, which inevitably accompanies wildfires but can also be experienced by communities far from the source of the wildfire — such as the smoke engulfing New York City from Canadian wildfires in 2023 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-lowreyNewYorkFailed2023"><strong>lowreyNewYorkFailed2023?</strong></a>)</span> — is managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Research on post-fire flooding and debris flows is published by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), while funding for private property flood mitigation is often routed through the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), unless it is funded and directed instead under the purview of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the event of federally declared disasters. States, counties, municipalities, fire districts, and nonprofits all interface with federal agencies in managing wildfire and post-fire watersheds in different ways.</p>
<p>This multi-jurisdictional but disunited management approach to the multiple hazards associated with wildfire and their implications for human lives results in disjointed preparedness. Readying the space surrounding one’s home in order for the house to better withstand a wildfire does not prepare a homeowner to prevent excessive exposure to wildfire smoke. Similarly, post-fire recovery is multifaceted and jurisdictionally complex. Homeowners may be faced with a number of different challenges, including life-threatening flooding, road and bridge access or damage issues, insurance claims, home rebuilding and permitting processes, hazardous trees, slash (woody debris) build-up, emotional and physical distress, infestations of invasive plant and insect species, property damage from bears, rodents, or decomposing food during evacuations and power shut-offs, and reforestation needs. Any one of these issues may be managed alternately by different federal, state, or county agencies or nonprofits or not managed by any jurisdiction at all. There may be resources and funding available for a short period to address certain challenges such as the sandbags provided by the Larimer County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) the first summer following the CPF in 2021 but not for subsequent flooding events in the summers of 2022 and 2023. These challenges may occur simultaneously or years apart from each other, highlighting the need for a pathway to recovery built in response to anticipated and unanticipated, or simply cascading, social-ecological disturbances over multiple timescales and jurisdictions. A pathway which includes funding mechanisms to address wildfire-related preparation, response, and recovery over a longer timeframe, accounts for cross-jurisdictional complexity, and provides a central hub of resources and support would reduce the navigational hurdles with which those confronting multiple hazards over a number of years have to contend.</p>

Among social scientists studying wildfire, there is broad recognition that wildfires have wide-ranging social impacts beyond that which can be captured by statistics. Compared to other disasters such as hurricanes or floods, research on the ways wildfires impact specific communities over time is less common, and ecological consequences may be easier to characterize than social ones <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kentSocialEconomicIssues2003"><strong>kentSocialEconomicIssues2003?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The concept of disturbance has also previously been leveraged to characterize wildfire impacts on people’s lives.

<div id="anthropological-approaches-to-disaster-landscape-and-time-1" class="section level4" number="4.3.0.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.3.0.1</span> Anthropological Approaches to Disaster, Landscape, and Time</h4>
<p>In spite of multidecadal research related to wildfire across disciplinary fields in the social sciences that has come to inform fire and emergency management strategies, the way we understand, prepare for, and respond to wildfires more generally continues to artificially separate social and ecological disturbances and their consequences over different timescales and across multiple jurisdictions. Anthropological scholarship identifies the temporal inscriptions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-adamsMarketsSorrowLabors2013">Adams 2013</a>)</span> and social lives of disasters <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sorensenSocialLifeDisasters2015"><strong>sorensenSocialLifeDisasters2015?</strong></a>)</span>, which, through various cultural processes, expand beyond the timeframe and physical perimeter of the disaster itself.</p>
<p>Anthropologists have encouraged the consideration of materialist conceptualizations of time and space <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mooreAnthropoceneAnthropologyReconceptualizing2016"><strong>mooreAnthropoceneAnthropologyReconceptualizing2016?</strong></a>)</span>, particularly in relation to the Anthropocene, the term proposed to signify a new geological epoch characterized by human-driven actions and processes. Whatever criticisms there may be of the term Anthropocene <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-millingtonHimalayanBuddhismHuman2024"><strong>millingtonHimalayanBuddhismHuman2024?</strong></a>)</span>, attending to the way human materialities and temporalities intersect with more than human material and temporal formations and processes requires us to conceptualize ‘an expansive ecology of time’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-widgerMonsoonUncertaintiesHydrochemical2020"><strong>widgerMonsoonUncertaintiesHydrochemical2020?</strong></a>)</span> which transcends a human-centered idea of history <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chakrabartyAnthropoceneTime2018"><strong>chakrabartyAnthropoceneTime2018?</strong></a>)</span> and the ‘complex conjunctures’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mooreAnthropoceneAnthropologyReconceptualizing2016"><strong>mooreAnthropoceneAnthropologyReconceptualizing2016?</strong></a>)</span> of the spaces of the Anthropocene. Following Tsing and coauthors, who propose that anthropologists engage with landscape to study how human and beyond human relations are structured relative to each other <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingPatchyAnthropoceneLandscape2019">A. L. Tsing, Mathews, and Bubandt 2019</a>)</span>, I use the post-wildfire landscape of the Poudre Canyon to understand the conditions of social and ecological disturbances resulting from the CPF and reverberating over time in response to each other. Situated ethnographic fieldwork over longer time horizons more typical in anthropology can illuminate narrative experiences of wildfire and its cascading consequences over time and help make sense of the ways in which these experiences are often connected to or exacerbated by the ecological disturbance cascade.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="study-site-1" class="section level2" number="4.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Study site</h2>
<p>As I describe in this section, the Poudre Canyon constitutes a landscape conducive to cascading geological hazards resulting from wildfire. There are 750 full-time and 1,500 part-time residents <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Us2024"><strong>Us2024?</strong></a>)</span>. The Poudre River parallels Highway 14 in the canyon for approximately forty miles as it flows along the contours of steep, forested slopes and rocky outcrops, supplying water for the hundreds of thousands of people in the populous Front Range cities of Fort Collins and Greeley. The Poudre Canyon’s two main population centers are divided between the lower and upper canyon. In 2012, the High Park Fire swept through the lower Poudre and several nearby communities, destroying 259 homes. In 2020, the CPF burned over much of the upper Poudre and fifteen other communities in Colorado over nearly four months. My own family’s historic home, and that of our neighbor’s, located in the upper Poudre, were the first two houses to burn in the fire, an experience which initiated this research inquiry.</p>
<p>The river corridor itself is made up of 85% federal lands, with only 2,000 out of 25,000 acres in private ownership <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-CachePoudreWild1990"><strong>CachePoudreWild1990?</strong></a>)</span>. The lands beyond the corridor are primarily owned by the USFS. Private lands are primarily situated along the river where flatter ground makes it easier to build, hemmed in by the canyon’s steep, rocky mountainsides, carved out by a glacier in the uppermost sections of the canyon, or by the river, below the glacier’s end moraine. Many, if not all, of these flatter pieces of land were formed either by alluvial fans, an accumulation of sediments that fans outward at the point where a steeper gradient meets a less steep gradient, or because they are part of the river’s old floodplain. The Poudre River watershed drains around 1,889 square miles in the canyon alone, although the river continues east as it flows out of the canyon, 125 miles in total until its confluence with the South Platte River on the eastern plains of Colorado. In populated areas of the Poudre, some of the river’s thousands of miles of tributaries pass through private lands, often in their lowest reaches before reaching the river. Most early settlers, and where the largest numbers of people continue to be based, built in proximity to a creek and prioritized settling land where they could ranch, mine, or extract timber, which was sent down the river during the years 1868 to 1885 to use as railroad ties <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-evansCachePoudreNatural1991"><strong>evansCachePoudreNatural1991?</strong></a>)</span>. This topography, formed by thousands of years of geologic movement, combined with land use and ownership established over shorter timescales, help shape the nature of the consequences which people in the Poudre experienced over the course of two large wildfires and in the years following these wildfires.</p>
<p>The Poudre is officially composed of three unincorporated communities <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-LarimerCountyColorado2024"><strong>LarimerCountyColorado2024?</strong></a>)</span>. Larimer County, and its Board of County Commissioners with three elected officials, is the defacto governing body for all unincorporated communities, although the Poudre Canyon Fire Protection District (PCFPD) is a local governmental entity whose jurisdiction for emergency response and wildfire management encompasses the entire populated length of the Poudre Canyon <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Us2024"><strong>Us2024?</strong></a>)</span>. Post-CPF recovery coordination was divided geographically in the Poudre Canyon between the City of Greeley, which has water rights to the Poudre River, and Larimer County. City of Greeley coordinated watershed recovery west, or upstream, of a bridge called Crown Point, and Larimer County was responsible for the areas east of this, or downstream.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods-2" class="section level2" number="4.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Methods</h2>
<p>I used ethnographic research methods to investigate how cascading hazards resulting from the CPF have cascading consequences for those affected by the wildfire. Ethnography is able to capture the situated, temporal complexities of how humans are affected by wildfires and associated hazards <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-mcgranahanWhatEthnographyTeaching2015"><strong>mcgranahanWhatEthnographyTeaching2015?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-jusionyteThresholdEmergencyResponders2018"><strong>jusionyteThresholdEmergencyResponders2018?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="participant-observation-2" class="section level3" number="4.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1</span> Participant Observation</h3>
<p>From June 2022 to October 2023, I lived in the upper Poudre and participated in activities such as social events, community association and fire board meetings, and site visits to private property and USFS lands impacted by wildfire or flooding. I joined the PCFPD as a volunteer and learned about how the fire district operates in relation to other agencies, such as the USFS and Larimer County Emergency Services. I attended conferences on wildland fire and natural hazards, joined educational tours and citizen science initiatives coordinated by local nonprofits, and participated in chipping and burning slash for neighbors.</p>
</div>
<div id="interviews-2" class="section level3" number="4.5.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2</span> Interviews</h3>
<p>I conducted fifty semi-structured interviews with community members, wildland fire, emergency and watershed management practitioners, and researchers whose studies intersect with ecological, geological, or social aspects of wildfire, post-fire flooding, or recovery. Of these, twelve also included open-ended conversations while walking in the CPF burn scar or accompanying researchers doing scientific fieldwork, a kind of walking interview <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-evansWalkingInterviewMethodology2011"><strong>evansWalkingInterviewMethodology2011?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-carpianoComeTakeWalk2009"><strong>carpianoComeTakeWalk2009?</strong></a>)</span>. In addition to interviews, I also used the go-along method <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kusenbachStreetPhenomenologyGoAlong2003"><strong>kusenbachStreetPhenomenologyGoAlong2003?</strong></a>)</span> to accompany three different teams of researchers — fluvial geomorphologists, biogeochemists, and geologists — in four wildfire-impacted watersheds during their fieldwork, and seven scientists and fire/watershed managers within areas of the CPF burn perimeter. I identified participants by meeting them at community events, conferences, and other events, through literature reviews, and snowball sampling.</p>
<p>My premise, reflected in the experiences of those I interviewed and the conditions I observed, is that wildfire initiates a series of ongoing, cascading impacts on people’s lives, captured through sustained research presence and engagement with community and expressed through narratives.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="categories-of-consequences-1" class="section level2" number="4.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Categories of Consequences</h2>
<p>In this section, I examine the different social consequences emerging from the 2020 CPF in the upper Poudre Canyon, showing that 1) social impacts on people’s lives can be categorized to capture the broad range of cascading experiences resulting from the original disturbance of the wildfire; 2) while social and ecological disturbances can occur in a kind of feedback loop, tracing ecological disturbances can help us anticipate social ones; and 3) the social-ecological disturbance cascade will be different for each community affected by wildfire but can be used to inform future scenarios for communities which have not yet experienced wildfire.</p>
<p>According to the measures typically used to account for how destructive a wildfire is, the upper Poudre fared reasonably well. Of the 492 structures destroyed in CPF, which lasted for 112 days, fewer than twenty were in the upper Poudre, which was the closest community to the wildfire and experienced two days of rapid fire growth over a month apart, affecting different sides of the canyon. Of the structures lost in the Poudre, none were primary homes, nobody died in the wildfire, including firefighters, even though it occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which complicated firefighting efforts and evacuations. These numbers, while important, do not contain within them the many ways people’s lives were disrupted by the wildfire that are essential for thinking through how to help other communities in the future respond to and recover from wildfire. Below, I provide some examples of social disturbance cascades, many of them linked to disturbances on the landscape.</p>
<div id="during-the-fire-1" class="section level3" number="4.6.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.1</span> During the Fire</h3>
<p>One couple in the upper Poudre was evacuated from their home the day the fire started just after stocking their refrigerator with groceries from Fort Collins. They were only able to return to their property seventy-three days later, after living in a hotel room with two cats. By the time they were permitted to return home, they had to replace their kitchen floor and their refrigerator on account of the food which had melted and rotted onto the floor when the power was shut off. One of their neighbors fared worse because his home was broken into multiple times by a bear who smelled the decomposing food and wreaked havoc throughout the house. The damage was so extensive he had to hire a contractor, who turned out to be corrupt. When I interviewed the neighbor about his experiences, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, in a lot of ways, the fire was the end at the same time that the fire was the beginning. It’s tough when I think about it and I get emotional still, I get very upset. What I grew up with and what was inculcated into my being about the woods and the wilderness and the animals and the views and a sense of belonging to all that. The fire ended that. And while I’m appreciative of the little oasis, I’m still devastated when I drive through the burn scar. So the fire was the end. But then the fire is also the beginning, like the forest floor coming back and wildlife returning. But it also was the beginning, the catalyst for all these subsequent events. The bear wouldn’t have been in here if the fire hadn’t burned through, and he wasn’t distressed and hungry. If I hadn’t evacuated and stuffed everything in the freezer thinking I’m gonna be back in a few days. And then the power gets shut off, and all of a sudden the cabin reeks, and he has a smorgasbord for four days. Never would have happened. If that hadn’t happened, I never would have had to hire this jackass of a contractor. And he wouldn’t have destroyed my house and done more damage than the bear did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the presence of wildlife is often awe-inspiring for Poudre Canyon residents and one of the reasons people enjoy living there. During and in the years since the wildfire, however, residents have encountered some animals in unusual ways: multiple break-ins from bears, sometimes at strange times, like the night of the Black Hollow debris flow in one of the surviving homes; extreme mice infestations in a home evacuated for a short time; packrats which had previously nested in a workshop which burned down moved into the house which survived; and a black widow infestation where none of these spiders had been seen before over multiple generations. Some of these impacts are short-lived, like the mice infestation, whereas others are persistent, like the packrat nests. These multispecies encounters <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ogdenAnimalsPlantsPeople2013"><strong>ogdenAnimalsPlantsPeople2013?</strong></a>)</span>, in their myriad forms, are one of the unaccounted-for categories of the consequences of wildfire.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that when it comes to people’s interactions with wildlife following the wildfire, not all have been negative. In the summer of 2023, an ecologist pointed out mating Lewis’s Woodpeckers on my family’s land in an area she said they would not have found habitat before the fire. Two people interviewed in 2023 observed that wildlife seems to be thriving after the wildfire based on their observations, more twin moose calves and fawns and more abundant and diverse wildlife sightings in general. This may point to another kind of opening when we connect social and ecological circumstances in examining wildfire’s impacts. People’s experiences and perceptions of ecological conditions in the Poudre help shape how they make sense of wildfire, of a changed and changing landscape, of the beginnings and ends of things and how they feel about them.</p>
</div>
<div id="after-the-fire-1" class="section level3" number="4.6.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.2</span> After the Fire</h3>
<p>For the people who did lose homes or other buildings to the wildfire, it set in motion its own series of cascading impacts, which are specific to this experience, in the form of loss of sense of place <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020"><strong>schlosbergDisasterPlaceJustice2020?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-maldonadoCooccurringAccumulatingDisasters2018"><strong>maldonadoCooccurringAccumulatingDisasters2018?</strong></a>)</span>, complicated insurance claims, regulations which did not exist when the original constructions were built, obstructions from the county permitting office, being underinsured and therefore unable to afford to rebuild, lack of reliable access to the homesite due to ongoing flooding or erosion issues, or inability to rebuild in the same location for similar reasons, all of which were realities for people who lost homes in the Poudre. One couple I interviewed who rebuilt their house themselves said they were assigned eight different insurance claims agents in a process they described as ‘belittling.’ Another family still has not been able to rebuild as of the summer of 2024 because parts of the road to their land are continually being eroded or obstructed from flooding off the steep channels on an adjacent mountainside.</p>
<p>Six more families lost their homes in the Black Hollow debris flow, and four people their lives, a tragic illustration of how the wildfire (that caused no immediate loss of life) then initiated an ecological disturbance cascade with devastating repercussions for the people whose lives intersected with it. We can trace other repercussions by following the flow of water. The centeredness of the river in this physical and cultural landscape draws our attention to particular human and other than human material relations and conveyances of risk, where the river reflects “the cumulative historical effects” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wohlVirtualRiversLessons2001"><strong>wohlVirtualRiversLessons2001?</strong></a>)</span> of everything in its basin. Many people must cross bridges over the river to get to their homes. Where historically the river was the central focus of mining and was used to transport logs for railroad ties, now it is what draws hundreds of thousands to the canyon each year for recreation. And in the first summer after the wildfire, it collected bodies, homes, logs, boulders, and sediment in a debris flow event, choking out fish, undermining two bridges, and affecting water supply storage systems in two downstream major population centers dozens of miles away.</p>
<p>Most people in the Poudre Canyon get their drinking water from wells. It is the hundreds of thousands of people living in the northern Colorado cities of Fort Collins and Greeley — and the municipal water managers for these cities — who have to contend with the water quality impacts to the Poudre River due to sediment transport from all the tributaries. The recently retired water manager for the City of Greeley told me in June 2023 that the city had to shut off their Poudre River water intake valves for forty days after the 2012 High Park Fire, at least a month the first summer after the CPF, and at least four times since then. Social and ecological disturbance cascades are not limited to the burn perimeter of the wildfire, and different geographies are subject to particular hazards over different timescales.</p>
<p>While residents in populous Front Range cities who rely on the Poudre River for drinking water are put at risk by the downstream effects of wildfire over time, those who live in the upper Poudre have been subject to what one geomorphologist responsible for designing much of the post-fire flood mitigation in the Poudre Canyon referred to as ‘nuisance flooding.’ I doubt this is how most people affected by flooding in the Poudre would characterize it, but the term is meant to indicate flooding which is not catastrophic, in contrast to the Black Hollow debris flow, for example. These smaller flooding events can still be scary and dangerous. Six inches of fast moving water can knock over an adult <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-usdepartmentofcommerceTurnDonDrown"><strong>usdepartmentofcommerceTurnDonDrown?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Flooding in the Poudre over the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023 impacted some of the same people again and again. One person’s basement was inundated with flood waters after the force of the water broke the window, and while the mitigation work that was done helped prevent water from entering the house again, their driveway was damaged by another flooding event more than a year later. I myself was unable to leave the place I was living on several occasions over two summers until a neighbor with heavy equipment came and moved all the rock out of the way which had accumulated on my access road from flooding events. Another couple shoveled sludge deposited by flood water out of their driveway and that of their neighbor’s at least twice. It was like shoveling cement, they said. Neighborhood and county roads in several places in the upper Poudre had to be repaired several times after being eroded by repeat flooding. As I write this at the end of May 2024, I received the first flash flood warning of the year for the CPF burn scar, unusually early and an indication that in the fourth summer after the fire, flooding danger continues to pose a hazard to lives, infrastructure, and watersheds. This signifies that both social and ecological disturbances persist, that as long as the watersheds in the Poudre Canyon continue to be affected by a disturbance cascade, so will its people.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>As part of understanding, and anticipating, the complex ways ecological and social disturbances exist in relation to each other following a wildfire, and in order to better assist in community recovery, we need more creative strategies. We need strategies which center people within the context of disturbance cascades linked to wildfire as much as watersheds, or rather which consider people as part of an integrated set of human and other human relations. In an assessment of the social and economic impacts from the 2002 Hayman Fire, which held the status of Colorado’s largest wildfire for eighteen years, a suggestion emerged from a series of post-fire interviews for the existence of a ‘national, interagency, rehabilitation coordinator’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kentSocialEconomicIssues2003"><strong>kentSocialEconomicIssues2003?</strong></a>)</span> to facilitate communication with the public and between agencies like the USFS and the NRCS to coordinate recovery efforts on private and public lands. Twenty-two years after the Hayman Fire, nothing like this has materialized.</p>
<p>I propose a modification of an ecological assessment following wildfires on USFS lands that could provide a helpful template for considering social-ecological disturbances over time. A team of specialists from the USFS across multiple resource areas, such as soil and watershed scientists, fire and forest ecologists, botanists, and archeologists, conduct what is called a Burned Area Emergency Assessment (BAER) following larger or more severe wildfires. The first assessment is done as soon as possible after or during a wildfire, in areas it has already passed through. The team uses a combination of rapid assessment tools, models, and professional judgement to assess threats to critical values on USFS lands as a result of the wildfire and determine a set of treatment options.</p>
<p>A soil scientist and BAER Program Coordinator with the USFS in Colorado explained to me that these ‘critical values on forest system lands are obviously just a subset of all values and concerns in the post-wildfire environment.’ Because some information collected by the BAER team is at a watershed scale, however, even though it is only conducted on USFS lands, it is collected in coordination with and can be utilized by county level emergency managers, municipal water providers, the state transportation department, and the USGS, among others. By way of example, the USGS makes a map and spatial data available to the public of preliminary debris flow hazard assessments at the drainage-basin scale using some information produced by the BAER team, such as field-validated soil burn severity data. This is some of the earliest and most accessible publicly available data to help private landowners determine their level of exposure to flooding or debris flows. My own family relied on the assessment published by the USGS in 2020 for the CPF to determine that it was unsafe to rebuild in the same location. Sometimes the BAER assessments occur over phases, although they are designed to be done as soon as possible after a wildfire.</p>
<p>I propose that, perhaps under the purview of a national, interagency rehabilitation coordinator, we draw on those aspects of BAER which might be relevant for assessing the combined social-ecological impacts following a wildfire. Rather than a team of specialists solely from the USFS and with expertise only in ecology, geology, fire, and archeology, each wildfire could be assigned a cross-jurisdictional team representing broader interests and land ownership, including quantitative and qualitative social scientists and a representative from the local fire district. The team’s explicit mission could be to gather information on and analyze social-ecological disturbances as part of a connected system, with the responsibility of conducting phased assessments and recommending recovery strategies over a timescale which accounts for the social-ecological disturbance cascade over a number of years. The existence of such a team would help remove artificial boundaries which currently exist between wildfire and post-fire watershed management and between these ecological phenomena and the impacts they have on people’s lives. Such a team would provide continuity, and accountability, to people and jurisdictions affected by wildfires during a bewildering and difficult time. Support for such an initiative would require federal funding and possibly the creation of new legislation. To this end, there is recognition of the difficulty of managing wildfire at the federal level by the USFS in the recently published Wildfire Crisis Strategy <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-forestserviceConfrontingWildfireCrisis2022">Service 2022</a>)</span> and by legislators in the form of funding allocated toward addressing wildfire challenges through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Given this and the extraordinary wildfire and climate change challenges communities and governments are facing across the world, it would benefit us all to pursue innovative strategies for living with, and recovering from, wildfire.</p>
<p>In this paper, I suggest that mobilizing the concept of a disturbance cascade which links social and ecological systems disrupted by wildfire expands our capacity for evaluating the social impacts of wildfire as a social-ecological disturbance cascade, both immediately following wildfires and over time. Ecological disturbance theory recognizes the complexity of how ecosystems respond to disturbances over different timescales <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gaiserLongTermEcologicalResearch2020"><strong>gaiserLongTermEcologicalResearch2020?</strong></a>)</span>. In the American West, flooding and debris flows are a known element in the wildfire disturbance cascade and an active area of scholarly inquiry <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-burnettFactorsInfluencingFlood2023"><strong>burnettFactorsInfluencingFlood2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-liuGuidanceParameterizingPostfire2023"><strong>liuGuidanceParameterizingPostfire2023?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-graberHowLongRunoffGenerated2023"><strong>graberHowLongRunoffGenerated2023?</strong></a>)</span>. Conceptualizing wildfire as dual disturbance cascades — both social and ecological — could facilitate research that examines the implications of flooding and debris flows following wildfire in a more systematic way. In turn, this would support awareness among emergency and land managers and legislators, the formation of policies which explicitly address post-fire flooding, and funding mechanisms which account for cascading hazards.</p>

<p><em>The World and Life Won’t be the Same Again</em></p>
<p>On a cold and blustery day in December 2022, I sat on a couch next to my grandfather’s cousin who would turn ninety-two years old on Christmas Day. We were warming ourselves in front of the woodstove in my extended family’s new house built just within the two year window mandated by our insurance company after our old house had burned in the Cameron Peak Fire. This house was in a different location because of flooding danger at the old homesite. One of my aunts sat in a rocking chair nearby. In a few days time, multiple other family members would arrive to celebrate Christmas together at the new house for the first time. This Christmas gathering was organized for Sarah Beth and for her cousin Shelley, also in her 90s. The two of them spent every summer of their childhoods at the old family house, in an era before electricity had been installed up the Poudre, when there were kerosene lamps and an ice box for refrigeration. Sarah Beth spanned all six generations of our family’s tenure in the Poudre Canyon. She held a repository of cumulative memories and represented an enduring sense of belonging passed down from one generation to the next in my family. At the same time, that one person’s lifetime could stretch across six generations extending over a total of nearly 130 years was an indication of how shallow my family’s history is in the Poudre, relative to Indigenous peoples who moved through this canyon for hundreds if not thousands of years <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-burrisPeoplePoudreEthnohistory2006">Burris 2006</a>)</span> and to the ecological and geological timescales of this landscape made more noticeable by fire and flooding. I asked Sarah Beth what it was like for her losing the old home and seeing the changes to the land as a result of the wildfire.</p>
<p>“Things don’t stay the same forever. …kind of the hope there…there’s still something to come. It’ll be different. History and good things don’t come to an abrupt end. They evolve into something different. Almost as big a change as the wildfire to the countryside is all the buildings along the way coming up now. It used to be none of those would be there and that made it very different. …I guess in some ways it’s the impermanence of life and things in places and just [being] thankful when that’s not the end, something else comes along.”</p>
<p>In this concluding chapter, I reflect on the themes represented by Sarah Beth’s enduring sense of belonging and reckoning with large-scale loss and change.</p>
<div id="insights-and-reflections" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Insights and Reflections</h2>
<p>Building on previous theorizations of landscape and disaster in anthropology and social science scholarship on wildfire more broadly, this dissertation introduces new contributions in understanding the social, ecological, and political trajectories of wildfire. Drawing on over two years of ethnographic research involving participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and a landscape-based methodology incorporating walking conversations and go-alongs, this dissertation explores the following research questions: how do people make sense of large-scale landscape transformations and affective dimensions of loss and change wrought by wildfire and post-fire flooding; and how do people intersect with institutional responses to wildfire risk and recovery?</p>
<p>I offer three new insights as a result of my research findings. First, I introduce the concept of the social-ecological disturbance cascade to highlight how social consequences from wildfires, particularly in mountain watersheds, often emanate from the cascading ecological hazards that wildfires initiate. Conceptually linking social and ecological disturbances is important. Wildfire smoke is increasingly understood as extremely hazardous. For example, smoke from agricultural fires in Indonesia in 2015 is estimated to have caused over 100,000 excess deaths across Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-koplitzPublicHealthImpacts2016">Koplitz et al. 2016</a>)</span>. Wildfire can also change the hydrological conditions of a watershed such that flooding, debris flows, and landslides are more likely for up to ten years following wildfire <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rengersLandslidesWildfireInitiation2020">Rengers et al. 2020</a>)</span>. All of these watershed-related hazards have intersecting consequences for people’s lives, both in areas where the wildfire occurred and downstream in the form of flooding, adverse water quality, or impacts to drinking water infrastructure. While ecological disturbances from wildfire are anticipated and constitute an active area of research, accompanying longitudinal social impacts are less understood and not as easily quantified. Accounting for multiple hazards across diverse jurisdictions and time horizons, and the complex and enduring ways people’s lives are affected, can help to reshape mechanisms for response and recovery to support the range of social and ecological disruptions associated with wildfire.</p>
<p>Second, I propose centering co-stewardship with and agency for communities in cultivating practices of living with fire. I challenge certain prevailing narratives, revolving around the personal responsibility of those who live in the wildland urban interface (WUI) to follow best practices to reduce wildfire risk around their homes. I argue that the language of personal responsibility and the widespread use of the term WUI are counterproductive to reducing risk and can be divisive in a few key ways. One, the idea of the WUI artificially separates those who live in flammable landscapes from those who do not, even though our assumptions about what constitutes a fire-prone landscape have been challenged in recent years by, for example, the largely suburban Marshall Fire in Colorado and the fire which tore through the town of Lahaina in Hawaii. Assumptions about the WUI obscure local cultural, political, and ecological contexts of wildfire risk and craft a singular idea of community wildfire exposure and the reasons behind it.</p>
<p>Two, the concept of the WUI reinforces an understanding of wildfire as contained within the perimeter of the burn area, ignoring the very real danger of wildfire smoke, which can affect places thousands of miles away, and post-fire flooding, which can impact communities and water quality many miles downstream from a fire. My research adds to existing scholarship on multi-hazard planning approaches <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-eatonWeFightAlberta2023">Eaton and Shneiderman 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-thompsonCapturingCascadingConsequences2024">Thompson et al. 2024</a>)</span> that recognizes the importance of attending to the full scope of how cascading hazards can be linked both socially and ecologically. I encourage a reconceptualization of those who live in fire-adapted landscapes as potential stewards rather than as agents of risk in co-producing strategies for living with fire. Living with fire is a process, in which individuals, communities, and governments are engaged, and only ever more so, as we reorient toward a world with more extreme wildfire. Expanding our understanding of geographies of risk could help communities better prepare for the multiple hazards associated with wildfire, and also assist policymakers and governments to identify infrastructure gaps for improved integrated response.</p>
<p>Third, my research shows that people who live with, study, and work in fire engage in processual sensemaking in response to extreme wildfire and the large-scale environmental changes that result from it. Cumulative sensemaking helps people recalibrate their relationship with landscapes affected by fire and post-fire flooding and debris flows, helping people to cope with affective and environmental disruptions. I found that among participants there is widespread acceptance of our inability to control fire, in spite of the fact that society operated for a long time as if it were something we could indefinitely control. Post-fire, a perception of nature as agentive and powerful shapes people’s understanding of fire and flood as ecological forces. My research indicates that for people intimately affected by disaster, recognizing ecological patterns and lifecycles within the destructive forces of fire and flood helps configure meaning out of the loss and change caused by them. This method of recalibration, intentional or unintentional, is a form of adaptive and agentive thinking that connects the “consequential materiality” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kosekUnderstoriesPoliticalLife2006">Kosek 2006</a>: 23)</span> of the past with the present and future. I argue that broadening our temporal horizons associated with the material world can help us better prepare for, respond to, and to some degree, accept ecologies of impermanence.</p>
</div>
<div id="theoretical-and-methodological-contributions" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Theoretical and Methodological Contributions</h2>
<p>My dissertation contributes to theoretical frameworks in anthropology, geography, and Indigenous Studies on temporality, materiality, and disaster. I build on these three sets of literatures through the lens of landscape, inspired by Tsing, Ingold, and Cresswell <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingWhenThingsWe2019">A. Tsing 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-ingoldBeingAliveEssays2011">Ingold 2011</a>; <a href="#ref-cresswellLandscapeObliterationPractice2003">Cresswell 2003</a>)</span>, who observe and immerse themselves in the material formations of the landscapes in which they conduct research. I contribute to a theoretical and methodological engagement with landscape as a means by which to understand the material entanglements of wildfire. Through “noticing landscapes” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingPatchyAnthropoceneLandscape2019">A. L. Tsing, Mathews, and Bubandt 2019</a>)</span> in the context of wildfire and post-fire watershed impacts, I encourage an expansion of the temporal and geographic frames through which society and governments prepare for, respond to, and recover from wildfire disturbance cascades. I introduce the concept of a social-ecological disturbance cascade to signify the linkages between the cascading hazards emanating from wildfire’s footprint in a culturally molded environment with their consequences for the human and more than human lives inhabiting that environment.</p>
<p>This dissertation builds on critical resilience and vulnerability approaches in disaster anthropology <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosResilienceCommentaryVantage2016">Barrios 2016</a>, <a href="#ref-barriosGoverningAffectNeoliberalism2017">2017</a>; <a href="#ref-hoffmanCultureCrucialFactor2015">Hoffman 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-adamsMarketsSorrowLabors2013">Adams 2013</a>)</span>. I show how, following the Cameron Peak Fire, as in other post-disaster contexts, people were subject to technocratic processes and political time <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zeeHoldingPatternsSand2017">Zee 2017</a>)</span> by capitalist-driven institutions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kleinShockDoctrineRise2008">Klein 2008</a>)</span> and the state in navigating insurance claims, rebuilding, and additional hazards, such as the removal of a bridge following damage by the Black Hollow debris flow. I also discuss how wildfire preparedness efforts are embedded in institutionalized, state-driven, bottom-up governance practices ascribing individual responsibility for risk reduction and prescribing the manner in which risk reduction can take place and the resources made available to implement such efforts. Wildfire risk reduction efforts target individuals and sometimes blame them for exposing themselves to wildfire by choosing to live in hazardous landscapes. I identify that settler colonial expansion facilitated by federal legislation continues to shape contemporary settlement patterns in fire-adapted landscapes and that the history of federal forest management contributes to wildfire risk in places like the Poudre Canyon. This dynamic has long been critiqued in the context of environmental degradation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-guthmanRepresentingCrisisTheory1997">Guthman 1997</a>)</span> and more recently in relation to climate change adaptation <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nightingalePowerPoliticsClimate2017">Nightingale 2017</a>; <a href="#ref-chakrabortyMountainsInequalityEncountering2023">Chakraborty, Rampini, and Sherpa 2023</a>)</span> in the Global South. My research contributes to the still limited scholarship highlighting similar state-citizen relationships in wildfire preparedness and recovery practices in the Global North.</p>
<p>Another important contribution from disaster anthropology and those researching dramatic and often traumatic environmental changes is in identifying the affective dimensions of coping with the devastation of the “built, natural, and social environments” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-barriosGoverningAffectNeoliberalism2017">Barrios 2017</a>: 5)</span> emergent in post-disaster contexts <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-asklandLivedExperiencesEnvironmental2018">Askland and Bunn 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-fowlerEmergingEnvironmentalEthics2018">Fowler 2018</a>)</span>. My research builds on this prior scholarship to examine the processual sensemaking practices in which community members, practitioners, and scientists engaged in the aftermath of the CPF, Colorado’s largest wildfire to date, what Frida Hastrup refers to as the everyday “process of theorising” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hastrupWeatheringWorldRecovery2011">Hastrup 2011</a>: 8)</span>. This dissertation contributes to uncovering how people understand and manage loss and change in the context of different disasters, of wildfire specifically, and in situated landscapes. People who live in the Poudre Canyon, who study forests and watersheds and work in fire, have intimate relationships with the river and streams, the trees, certain geographic features, and the shape of the terrain itself. I suggest that people recalibrate their relationship to place and to the material lifeworlds contained within it through constructing meaning out of landscape changes rooted in an ecological understanding of those changes.</p>
<p>This dissertation also contributes methodologically to previous theoretical and empirical engagements with landscape <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-tsingMushroomEndWorld2015">A. Tsing 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-carlsonAgenciesPresentLandscapemaking2022">Carlson 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-benderIntroduction2020">Bender 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-mathewsLandscapesThroughscapesItalian2018">Mathews 2018</a>)</span>. I show how observations and movements on, through, and with human and more than human beings in a wildfire-affected landscape is critical in understanding the temporal and material configurations and agencies of the past and of a landscape becoming.</p>
</div>
<div id="research-implications" class="section level2" number="5.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Research Implications</h2>
<p>My research findings are situated in a particular landscape revolving around a small community of people who live and work in and study this environment. It is only one of sixteen communities impacted by the CPF, and it suffered disproportionately fewer structure losses relative to the total number lost throughout the fire perimeter. One may ask how and why research about such a small place, so few people, so few home losses, matters for larger conversations or policy discussions about wildfire, disaster, or climate change. The arguments I lay out in this dissertation reflect precisely why the experiences of people during and after the CPF in the context of their lives in the Poudre Canyon matter for how we think about, plan for, respond to, and recover from wildfires everywhere.</p>
<p>First, as I describe in Chapter 2, recovery programs emerging from quantitative assessments of wildfire impacts such as structure loss can obscure less visible, more complex consequences and limit our temporal and spatial perceptual horizons to certain time periods and geographies. This leaves us less prepared to assign resources for long term recovery. Through ethnographic engagement with the Poudre Canyon community and with those who conduct research and work as fire and emergency practitioners here, my research uncovers the complexities and enduring emotional and structural challenges of post-fire recovery. Conceptually incorporating the social-ecological disturbance cascade in planning and policy formulations would inform management decisions, allocate resources, and encourage cross-jurisdictional cooperation in responding to timeframes and impacts associated with multiple, cascading hazards radiating out from wildfire.</p>
<p>Second, the upper Poudre Canyon is an example of a community in the WUI which both aligns with and defies assumptions about those who live in what I prefer to call fire-adapted landscapes. Demographically, this is not a community that is growing in population nor one in which new homes are continuously being built. It is, however, located in a forested, largely federally managed landscape, much of it now burned. As I describe in the Introduction and in Chapter 3, the patterns of settlement here are primarily attributable to the expulsion of Indigenous peoples from this area combined with federal legislation encouraging settler expansion across the western U.S. Federal forest management policies over the last century shaped the contemporary composition of forests and the behavior of fire. Ethnographic attention to the political and environmental histories of specific places highlighting the heterogeneity of communities grappling with wildfire risk, preparedness, and recovery can help shape policy and management approaches that account for the complex realities on the ground in different ecological, climatic, and weather contexts.</p>
<p>Third, the Poudre Canyon as a rural, unincorporated area has a particular relationship to risk exposure and management and to cross-jurisdictional governance. This dissertation explores what it means to live on relatively small pieces of land under county jurisdiction surrounded by vast federally managed landscapes, governed primarily from afar, in the context of wildfire and post-fire flooding. In Chapter 3, I outline how risks and hazards intersect with jurisdictional complexity and land and water management practices in a place where: the forests are owned by the USFS; the water is allocated to downstream municipalities but governed in part by a federal Wild &amp; Scenic designation; the wildlife is managed by the state; wildfire is managed by the state but usually first by the fire district, followed by the county, unless the fire is on federal lands, in which case it is managed by the USFS; people and private properties are governed by the county, which also manages emergencies; and the highway running through the canyon is managed by the state. I also provide ethnographic context in describing how the only local government — the Poudre Canyon Fire Protection District (PCFPD) — and private landowners model important roles in risk management and land stewardship practices that benefit ecological systems and populations extending beyond the confines of the Poudre Canyon that could be applied elsewhere.</p>
<p>Fourth, attending to how people who have different kinds of relationships to the Poudre Canyon make sense of landscape-altering wildfire and post-fire flooding contributes to knowledge production guiding how we all might better understand the human and more than human materialities and temporalities of the world we live in and how we might cope with living in a more fiery world with all its repercussions.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-research-possibilities" class="section level2" number="5.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Future Research Possibilities</h2>
<p>This dissertation opens up a more expansive research agenda for ethnographic engagement with wildfire and its human and more than human entanglements <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-martindaleEntanglementTinkeringStructural2009">Martindale 2009</a>)</span>. In Colorado, the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe are the only Indigenous groups with reservations and governments headquartered in the state, in spite of a history of at least forty-eight tribes having lived in what is now called Colorado at some time in the past and with over 200 Tribal Nations currently represented just in the Denver metro area <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-daleyLongDenverWas2023">Daley 2023</a>)</span>. What do these histories mean for the legacies of land use practices in this state that continue to inform how people and ecologies interact with wildfire?</p>
<p>In Chapters 2 and 3, I address the jurisdictional complexities of wildfire in a place like the Poudre and trace some of these complexities back in time to land use practices deriving from federal policies dispossessing Indigenous peoples of land and encouraging settler colonial inhabitance on those lands. How different governance regimes influence relationships between citizens and the state is a subject which merits broader explorations than I cover in this dissertation, particularly for rural, unincorporated communities, and a subject for which greater ethnographic research is important. The broad theme of governance in relation to rural, unincorporated areas and how this affects planning and management practices around forest, fire, and flood management is also germane to how disaster recovery manifests for people in these areas. Although one-third of people in the U.S. live in unincorporated areas <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-riveraEquitableRecoveryUnincorporated2024">D. Rivera, Breder, and Dodd 2024</a>)</span>, research on lack of local governance or the role of rurality in disasters is still somewhat limited <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-riveraUnincorporatedUnderservedCritical2023">D. Z. Rivera 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-kapucuDisasterPreparednessResilience2013">Kapucu, Hawkins, and Rivera 2013</a>)</span> across disaster literatures writ large and as part of ethnographic research in particular.</p>
<p>Drawing on themes emerging from my research in the Poudre Canyon, I am interested in further explorations around the implications of being surrounded by federal land, managed for the public good, administered from afar, the governance of which invariably disproportionately affects those whose lives intersect with its borders. The geographer Jake Kosek examines this question in the context of a rural community in northern New Mexico <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kosekUnderstoriesPoliticalLife2006">Kosek 2006</a>)</span> where land grants dictated the prescription of lands as communal for certain communities but where over time, the USFS managed to fold these lands under federal jurisdiction. His work, and the question of how communities are impacted, in both positive and negative ways, by living in proximity to federal public lands, was made all the more relevant in 2022 when two fires started by the USFS merged to become New Mexico’s largest wildfire decimating the same rural, northern New Mexico communities Kosek wrote about nearly twenty years ago. It also points to the importance of illuminating local geographic, ecological, political, and social contexts, highlighting how ethnography can contribute to policy planning and governance discussions. Speaking to the question of jurisdictional complexity in governance practices, what does it mean for critical infrastructure such as private bridges, originally privately and affordably built, to be subject to contemporary county and federal regulations rendering their ongoing maintenance or replacement unaffordable, as in the case of the Poudre Canyon? And how does disaster planning and recovery intersect with this reality?</p>
<p>Because we are deemed to be in the middle of a “wildfire crisis” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-forestserviceConfrontingWildfireCrisis2022">Service 2022</a>)</span> by the U.S. Forest Service’s own estimation, what does this say about the capacity of this agency to effectively manage forests and fire? The archeologist Bruce Trigger writes that “what pass as historical traditions are often mythical charters explaining and validating current social relations and these change as social relations change” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-triggerNativesNewcomersCanadas1985">Trigger 1985</a>: 167)</span>. Historians such as Stephen Pyne <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pyneFireAmericaCultural1997">Pyne 1997</a>)</span> and Jan van Wagtendonk <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-vanwagtendonkHistoryEvolutionWildland2007">van Wagtendonk 2007</a>)</span> have both written about the history of the USFS and wildfire management in the U.S. There remains a role, however, for anthropological research in picking apart how to understand the purview of an agency like the USFS in relation to the trajectory of its landscape ideologies over time and how its competing interests — timber sales versus thinning and prescribed fire for ecological and fire risk reduction purposes, for example — shape the outcomes of wildfire and forest management. Future research could examine the tensions inherent in an agency like the USFS illuminating where investments and policies need to change in order for this country to adequately prepare for the kinds of wildfires we are seeing today and to recover from them, both socially and ecologically.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, I develop the idea of cultivating stewardship, of land and of fire, among communities who live in fire-adapted landscapes and criticize interactions with homeowners that rely on harmful narratives, such as the notion of personal responsibility. I make brief reference to Amy Johnson’s term “settlerism” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-johnsonSettlerSensibilitiesEnvironmental2023">Johnson 2023</a>)</span>, or the idea that landscapes are shaped by colonial settlement projects, which I have also alluded to here in the Conclusion. Part of the basis of my argument promoting a perception of people in the Poudre as potential stewards stems from learning during my fieldwork about the deep connections and care people in the Poudre have for the river, the forests, the wildlife, and for some families, to particular places named and routinely visited over multiple generations. There is an enduring and important relationship here with place, even though the existence of this relationship is born out of a violent past enabling the settlement of non-Indigenous peoples in the first place. At the Cross-Boundary Landscape Resilience Workshop I attended in May 2023, which was primarily about wildfire, I listened to the Tribal Projects Coordinator for the USFS speak on a panel. She said tribes need decision-making powers to determine their own pathway toward collaboration with other government entities and that tribal nations’ interests cannot only be represented by numbers. Stories and relationships are what matter in creating resilient partnerships, she said, and criticized the transactional nature of collaboratives attempting to work with tribal nations in the U.S. In my notes from the workshop about this panel, I wrote, “We can learn from these kinds of identifications and delineations and lessons around working with tribal communities. All communities’ interests should be engaged through storytelling and relationships.” What are the implications of mobilizing similar language and strategies for collaborating with Indigenous sovereign nations in order to highlight settler connections to landscapes and the meaning of these connections in developing land and fire stewardship practices?</p>
<p>Another interesting area of research for an anthropology of wildfire is in multi-sited ethnography examining wildfire narratives, land use practices, and ecological conditions in places with different cultural, political, and environmental histories. As I discussed in Chapter 3, entrenched assumptions exist regarding what is referred to as the WUI in the United States, and particularly in the western U.S., one of which is the idea that the ‘wildfire problem’ — or the ‘WUI problem,’ such as it is called — is constituted by the [increasing] presence of people in landscapes that burn. In areas of Mediterranean Europe, the wildfire problem is inversely characterized. It is agricultural abandonment and the absence of people in rural areas which is understood to leave them more susceptible to wildfire <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-moreiraModellingImpactAgricultural2007">Moreira and Russo 2007</a>)</span>. What can we learn about how people understand and live with wildfire risk in different parts of the world that can inform the futures we choose to create in a world with more fire and ever more uncertain climates?</p>
<p>There is much more to examine in relation to understanding what it means to live with fire. As I have drawn attention to in this dissertation, wildfire, like other disasters, exists in relation to other hazards. I have identified how practices encouraged as part of living with fire often do not address how to live with smoke as well as wildfire risk, for example, or with post-fire flooding. A multi-hazard relationship which I am particularly interested to explore further is that between extreme heat and wildfire, particularly in the context of wildfire risk reduction measures. What are the implications for places where people are simultaneously exposed to these hazards within their homes? The Home Ignition Zone which provides guidance on reducing wildfire risk in five, thirty, and 100 foot zones out from the house includes recommendations to cut down trees which may contribute to igniting a home or igniting other trees as a ladder fuel. How consequential is removing trees from near homes in terms of extreme heat exposure? How should we consider the role of air conditioning and power outages during wildfires and wildfire smoke exposure in providing guidance to homeowners to remove trees providing shade? How might existing inequalities be exacerbated by risk reduction measures which attempt to reduce one hazard but introduce another?</p>
</div>
<div id="outro" class="section level2" number="5.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Outro</h2>
<p>I attended a presentation in January 2024 by a landscape architect who, taking inspiration from Dutch perceptions of and designs considering water as a hazard, developed three strategies for cultivating practices of living in fire-affected and -adapted landscapes, characterized as defensive, resilient, and resistant <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gorskiBurntTaleThree2023">Gorski 2023</a>)</span>. His designs were beautiful and innovative, incorporating ideas for trails that guide visitors through forest mosaics comprising recently burned, young, and mature forests with lookout towers and burnt memorials along the way. I thought of this as intentionally cultivating an aesthetic for burned landscapes, a way to encourage people to recalibrate their relationship with particular ecologies.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, I went for a hike on a USFS trail that had been closed to the public for three years and had only been opened a couple months prior after sustaining damage from the CPF. USFS signs at trailheads here all follow a certain template. There is a map and description of the trail, information about what users are allowed on the trail, and warnings about the presence of ticks, mountain lions, and bears. I was dismayed to see that there was no information explaining the three year-long trail closure, the CPF, or anything contextualizing this scorched but regenerating landscape, such as a suggestion to look out for new lodgepole pine seedlings and the particular fire adaptation of serotiny in some lodgepole pines. Certainly, the USFS is experiencing both funding and staffing challenges that might explain the absence of any context at all, but it is reflective of a broader cultural and political lack of attention to the affective dimensions of living with fire.</p>
<p>INSERT PHOTO OF ROARING CREEK TRAILHEAD</p>
<p>This dissertation demonstrates that people come to terms with loss caused by the wildfire and associated hazards in part through an understanding of ecological patterns and possibilities. I advocate for further research considering how we might create pathways for normalizing and cultivating our relationships with burned landscapes and for assigning more resources at different jurisdictional levels to do so. This is another ripe area for further ethnographically engaged research. We are living in a world with more conflagrations, and learning how to cope with this reality is an ongoing process of recalibration, not just for communities but also for fire practitioners, emergency managers, and scientists. The task at hand is not just about living with fire, which people have been doing for a long time, but about living with potentially ecologically and socially devastating fire with long term repercussions for forests, watersheds, and people. At the same time, it is about cultivating an appreciation for the nuances of how fire moves across particular landscapes and interacts with different tree species, for example, which have adapted to fire over time in diverse ways, for some of which moderate to high severity fire may be within its historical range of variability. Individuals, communities, and governments need to prepare for and respond to fire and its accompanying hazards situated in a realistic understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of harm and loss while also contextualizing the regenerative, ecologically beneficial functions of fire and flood.</p>
