This dissertation is an independent and original work by Maya Daurio, who conceived and 
performed all aspects of the research (including research design, ethics, field research, analysis, 
and presentation of results). 

Chapters 2 and 3 were submitted as articles to two journals, respectively, and are under peer review at the time of submission of this dissertation. I also plan on submitting Chapter 4 to a peer-reviewed journal.

This research was approved by the UBC Behavioural Research Ethics Board, certificate number H22-01084, approved initially on May 16, 2022, and renewed as needed thereafter (PI: Dr. Mark Turin).
