One of the mysteries of graduate school is the persistent experience of feeling as though one is the first person to have ever navigated the numerous requirements and procedures in the process of obtaining a PhD. I would have been entirely lost without the time, feedback, expertise, and documentation provided by my fellow graduate students. The prolonged interruption of the COVID-19 pandemic six months into my PhD program, which prevented in-person interactions for some time, did not diminish the support and guidance provided by my colleagues, to whom I owe a great debt of gratitude. Thank you to Stephen Chignell, Byron Arthur Clark, Raphaël Deberdt, Anudeep Dewan, Eric Simons, Patrick Dowd, Jonathan Eaton, Vicki Sear, Lara Şarlak, Eric Simons, Kawin Tiansuwan, Bendi Tso, and Caitlyn Yates.

I am grateful for the financial support provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada through the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship and the Explore Research Assistantship Grant; P.E.O. International; the Social Science Research Council of the United States through the Rapid-Response Grants on Covid-19; the UBC Public Scholars Initiative and Climate Emergency Fund; the UBC Four-Year Fellowship; the Esri Canada GIS Scholarship; Dr. Marianne Ignace, and the Anthropology Graduate Studies Committee.

I deeply appreciate the engaging and financially supportive employment, research, and mapping opportunities provided by numerous individuals and organizations during my time at UBC, including by Dr. Mark Turin, Dr. Andrew Martindale, Dr. Leslie Robertson, the UBC Research Commons, the Community Engaged Documentation and Research (CEDaR) cluster, the Environmental Justice Co-Lab, Dr. Daniel Heath Justice, Dr. Bendi Tso, and Dr. Marnyi Gyatso.

I am grateful for the diverse research engagements throughout my PhD (many facilitated by my supervisor Dr. Mark Turin) and the opportunity to work alongside and learn from scholars including Dr. Sienna Craig, Dr. Daniel Kaufman, Dr. Ross Perlin, Nawang Tsering Gurung, and Jag Bahadur Budha.

My heartfelt thanks to Dr. Pasang Sherpa, Dr. Serbulent Turan, P.E.O. Chapter D of Whitefish, and Taylor Greenup for your engagement with and support of my work.

My deepest gratitude to Gyata Sandoval for creating and providing such a beautiful refuge for Wilbur and me, and for your kindness and generosity in helping me weather the pandemic and graduate school in general. Thank you to Raphael Sandoval, Camila Fernandez, and Hannah Avenant for your kindness toward and care of Wilbur. 

ERASE And to Marnyi Gyatso, Rachelle Delaney, Kailey Rocker, Dovana Singh, Anna Lmr, and Colleen Hillis for meals, support, games, walks, and rides.

My success at UBC would have been impossible without the careful coordination and support of the staff in the Department of Anthropology facilitating graduate students in overcoming all the administrative hurdles we must navigate. Thank you, too, to the maintenance and cleaning staff, performing critical and often invisible work that makes it possible for us to occupy the spaces we do.
